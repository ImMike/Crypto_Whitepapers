<h2 id="page_link_1">Vision</h2>

<p>Today, the crypto market is growing at an astronomical rate. Profits from cryptoassets are off the charts, the ROIs from some of them is in the thousands of a percent. Amidst such conditions, more and more people are burning up with the desire to invest their assets into cryptocurrencies and ICOs on a daily basis.</p>

<p>However, this is a challenging market, one in which not only is acute knowledge of the fields of finance and trading necessary, but a deep understanding of technology too. As a result, analyzing the market takes a lot of energy and time, which ends up being the biggest problem with new investors. In such conditions, many of them simply reject the idea of investing in cryptoassets.</p>

<p>Besides that, every month, new cryptocurrencies and hundreds of ICOs are popping up. It is quite difficult for new investors to study every new project. That&rsquo;s why the few that actually do decide to enter the market, simply invest in BTC or ETH, and that&rsquo;s where the story ends. As a result, beginner investors lose out on the opportunity to significantly increase their profits.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, there are experienced cryptoinvestors that have figured out all of the markets functional nuances. By properly formulating their portfolios out of cryptocurrencies and ICO tokens, they can gain impressive profits in a short amount of time. Though, these types of investors encounter a different problem. The quantity of funds that they can manage, are limited to their own personal money.</p>

<p>Besides this, there are&nbsp;exist large professional players within the market - cryptofunds. They demonstrate colossal profits in comparison to common traditional market metrics, but they run into a row of problems that stump their development:</p>

<ul>
	<li>First off, an absence of a regulatory framework in most countries&nbsp;leads to additional&nbsp;difficulty for cryptofunds to assure investors, especially outside the bounds of their regions, that their funds will remain secure. This seriously localizes their operations and limits the amount of new clients, especially from other countries. As a result, professional market participants are commonly restricted to working with local&nbsp;clients and experience difficulties in attracting new funds to manage.</li>
	<li>Secondly, it&#39;s challenging for professionals to work with small investors, since communication costs with such clients frequently exceed&nbsp;profits. In order to avoid spending a mass of time on communicating with clients that invest small sums, they are forced to establish high entry barriers, which in turn decrease the amount of funds they manage, and as a result, profits.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>All of the problems mentioned above might become barriers to the future developments of the crypto market.</p>

<p>The recipe for a solution to these problems is the Safinus platform. The platform connects new investors and portfolio managers (experienced private investors and cryptofunds), erasing all barriers standing in the way of receiving high profits while providing all of the necessary conditions for a mutually beneficial cooperation.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="page_link_3">Market Overview</h2>

<h3 id="page_link_3_1">Analysis of current tendencies</h3>

<p>The cryptocurrency boom drew a lot of interest towards cryptocurrencies and ICOs amongst plenty of investors and common folk. Unbelievable return rates, around the clock availability of the biggest exchanges, and an absence of many limitations and restrictions, that are present in the traditional financial market - all of this leads to an explosive growth of cryptoasset popularity.</p>

<div class="pic_block"><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/"><img alt="" src="/media/uploads/2018/01/16/wp_graph_1.jpg" style="height:527px; width:1062px" /></a></div>

<p><strong>Image 1.</strong> Growth of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization for 2017 (data from coinmarketcap.com)</p>

<p>The high volatility of the cryptoasset market allows experienced private investors and cryptofunds to acquire monthly profits that are many times greater than those of a traditional market.</p>

<p>Today, the most popular way of attracting capital is through an ICO (Initial Coin Offering). The given method has a lot of benefits over other means of attracting capital, such as the absence of paper shuffling, almost any commissions, and a direct connection to investors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite the fact that this form of attracting financing appeared not so long ago, the volume of invested funds has already surpassed the long-established venture fund industry!&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Image 2. </strong> Quarterly ICO fund acquisitions for 2017</p>

<p>But can a regular individual, who is not a professional trader, simply start investing in ICOs? Of course he can. But only if he is ready to devote a big portion of his time towards deeply studying and understanding the industry.</p>

<p>But why does it require so much time and intellectual resources? Because the ICO market is different because of technological challenges, legal uncertainty and the exponential growth of new companies.</p>

<p>This is what a graph of the amount of new ICOs appearing every month:&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a result of the sweeping growth of new ICOs, it is becoming difficult to pick a project for investing with every passing day.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="page_link_3_2">Current market problems&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Investment profits are not the only things that are growing together with cryptoassets, the number of problems that new investors, as well as experienced market participants run into are growing.</p>

<h4 id="page_link_3_2_1">Problems of new investors&nbsp;</h4>

<p>The main problem troubling new investors is the necessity to spend a considerable amount of energy and time studying all of the details of the cryptomarket.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First off, the Blockchain and other technologies connected to the cryptomarket are constantly developing and becoming more complex. While a lot of <strong>investors do not possess technical knowledge</strong>. This makes investments in cryptocurrencies more challenging, and especially ICOs, which commonly employ complex technical solutions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Secondly, when investing funds in ICO tokens, investors are forced to spend a <strong>tremendous amount of time on searching and picking a quality project for investing</strong>. In order to not turn cryptoinvestments into a lottery, and to make a well thought out decision, its necessary to <strong>at least</strong> study the following behind each company:&nbsp;</p>

<div class="two_col_ul">
<ul>
	<li>The market, for which the company&#39;s product is meant.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The products ability to solve the markets problem.</li>
	<li>Competitors in the market.</li>
	<li>White Paper.</li>
	<li>Readiness of the product.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>The amount of previously acquired funds (if any).&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The team, its competence, and public activity.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Partners and company advisers.</li>
	<li>Distribution structure of ICO tokens.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, many investors are scared away <strong>by the lack of a clear regulatory framework </strong>in terms of the ICO market. Also, the absence of regulations attracts <strong>a lot of scammers</strong>, that take advantage of inexperienced investors in order to satisfy their selfish goals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This situation forces market participants to analyze huge amounts of information on an almost daily basis in order to not make a mistake and lose their capital.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a result, all beginner investors can be split into two groups:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Those that completely deny the thought of investing in cryptoassets in light of an absence of desire to dive into studying the market and its unicalities.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Those that have acquired some base knowledge and invested their funds only in BTC or ETH, while not having any interest in figuring out all of the other cryptocurrencies and ICO tokens.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>These events lead to a decrease in investment inflows into the market and large volumes of lost profits.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="page_link_3_2_2">Problems of experienced private investors</h4>

<p><strong>Experienced private investors </strong>- individuals that understand the market well, and frequently receive good profits.</p>

<p>The main problem of private investors is a <strong>limit on managed funds</strong>. Meaning that their investments are limited to their own funds.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="page_link_3_2_3">Problems of cryptofunds</h4>

<p>First off, it is difficult for cryptofunds <strong>to attract new clients, especially outside the bounds of their home region</strong>, since there the absence of legal frameworks scares away investors from other countries. Moreso, it is challenging for funds to prove their qualifications and verify their revenue in front of investors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Currently, many professional players are taking various steps in order to increase the transparency of their business operations. As an example, actions involving all of the cryptofunds wallets can be disclosed. But it is challenging for an investor to monitor the funds growth dynamics over ten of different wallets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A lack of tools that can increase the trust levels of investors lead to weak, overall, developments of fund management, significant decreases in cryptoasset investments, and the loss of potential profits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The next problem of professional market participants is the <strong>high amount of communication efforts required</strong> when working with small clients. Many small investors, who have invested insignificant amounts start attacking portfolio managers with questions at the slightest price fluctuations, or after reading some news about changes in the cryptocurrency and ICO spheres. At that, the profits off of small investors is not too great. As a result, cryptofunds establish entry barriers that are quite high, in order to escape these problems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, establishing these barriers leads to the amount of assets controlled by cryptofunds to decrease, since these barriers prevent a significant amount of new investors from entering the market.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because of these problems, it&#39;s challenging for cryptofunds to attract capital, which decrease the volume of managed funds and leads to lost profits.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="page_link_3_3">Conclusion</h3>

<p>All of the aforementioned problems limit the development of trusted cryptoasset management, which in itself negatively impacts the markets growth dynamics.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Experienced private investors operate using their personal assets, and cryptofunds experience difficulties in broadening their circle of investors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the same time, a lot of inexperienced investors bump into problems when attempting to enter the market. A significant portion of them can&rsquo;t, or does not want to independently figure out all of the its nuances, and as a result, reject investing in cryptoassets altogether, or limit themselves to investing in only well-known base currencies like BTC and ETH.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Solving these problems will allow for an increase of capital from new investors, and significantly broaden trade volumes. This will help the market grow even more.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="page_link_4">What is the Safinus platform?</h2>

<p>The Safinus platform is composed of the following key components:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Portfolio creation mechanism,</strong> which allows experienced investors (or funds) to create their cryptocurrency and ICO portfolios on the platform, and any (even the most inexperienced) investors to join a portfolio with his funds in just a few clicks.</li>
	<li><strong>Universal portfolio rating,</strong> that is created automatically through saved and verified Blockchain information regarding portfolio earnings.</li>
	<li><strong>Individual cryptoasset management mechanism,</strong> that allows professional traders to cater to large investors individually.</li>
	<li><strong>Voting system for adding cryptocurrencies and ICO,</strong> which allows only community and trader verified authentic cryptocurrencies and ICO&#39;s to be added to the platform. It protects platform users from scams.</li>
	<li><strong>Mechanism for simultaneous trading on multiple exchanges</strong> through a single interface, which guarantees asset liquidity in portfolios.</li>
	<li><strong>The decentralized cryptocurrency exchange,</strong> which will replace centralized services and will allow assets to be controlled transparently, and with absolute security in the future.</li>
	<li><strong>Instruments for the automatization</strong> of cryptocurrency trade strategies and portfolio management.</li>
</ol>

    <div class="icon seven">Portfolio Mechanism</div>
</div></p>

<p>Next we will take a look at each of the Safinus platforms components in more detail.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="page_link_4_1">Portfolio joining mechanisms, universal, portfolio rating system</h3>

<p>The mechanism functions as follows:</p>

<h4 id="page_link_4_1_1">1. Portfolio creation.</h4>

<p>First of all, experienced investors or professionals (traders and funds) create portfolios out of cryptocurrencies and tokens.</p>

<p>In order to create a portfolio, the following is required:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Register on the platform, filling out the required information.</li>
	<li>Create a portfolio, describing the strategy which will be used to manage portfolio assets.</li>
	<li>Fill their SAF token balance to create portfolio.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="page_link_4_1_2">2. Depositing personal funds into the portfolio.</h4>

<p>The portfolio creator deposits his own funds into the portfolio and distributes them across various cryptocurrencies and ICO tokens. The portfolio creator decides on the initial amount of funds that will be invested into the portfolio by himself. The greater the initial amount, the higher the trust that investors will have towards a portfolio, due to the fact that the portfolio manager is risking his own/personal funds as well.</p>

<h4 id="page_link_4_1_3">3. Establishing portfolio joining criteria.</h4>

<p>The portfolio creator can establish criteria under which investors can join the portfolio. The creator can:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Set fixed commissions for joining and leaving the portfolio.</li>
	<li>Set commissions from investor&rsquo;s earnings.</li>
	<li>Set a minimum period of time that an investor can join the portfolio for.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="page_link_4_1_4">4. Investor portfolio selection.</h4>

<p>Investors will study the ratings of the portfolios created on the platform, which will be based on transparent, Blockchain verified earnings and volume of managed funds.</p>

<p>Safinus automatically evaluates platform portfolios in USD based on exchange rates from popular exchanges (Poloniex, HitBTC, Bittrex). If a portfolio holds ICO tokens which have not yet been added to exchanges, their value will be based on the purchase price and will not change until the token becomes available for trading on exchanges.</p>

<p>The value of portfolios is calculated on a daily basis; therefore, investors will always have up to date information pertaining to the value of a portfolio and its earnings.</p>

<h4 id="page_link_4_1_5">5. Investor portfolio joining.</h4>

<p>In just a few clicks, investors can join any portfolio on the platform and add their capital to them. Investors can join multiple portfolios that they like at the same time.</p>

<h4 id="page_link_4_1_6">6. Earnings of the portfolio manager.</h4>

<p>Portfolio creator&rsquo;s earnings, from portfolio management, are based on a commission that they establish for each created portfolio individually. There are two types of commissions &ndash; a fixed commission for investors joining and leaving the portfolio (generally ranges from 0% to 5%) and a percentage from the earnings of investors from the portfolio (generally ranges from 10% to 30%). Earnings are fixated either when a portfolio is exited, or once a year (depending on what occurs first).</p>

<h4 id="page_link_4_1_7">7. Investor&rsquo;s Earnings.</h4>

<p>Investors gain a slice from the portfolio valuation based on their investment. Example:</p>

<div class="white_block">
<p>The portfolio carries cryptocurrencies valued at $9,000.</p>

<p>An investor decides to join a portfolio, investing $1,000. Now, the sum total of the portfolio is $10,000, therefore, the investor now owns 10% of the portfolio.</p>

<p>Half a year has passed, the value of the portfolio has doubled and is now $20,000</p>

<p>The investor decides to leave the portfolio, fixating his earnings. This can be accomplished in just a few clicks. Due to the fact that he is entitled to 10% of the portfolio value, he will go on to receive $2,000 (before commissions and fees).</p>
</div>

<p>

    <a href="/static/ver142/pages/img/schemes/1_en.png" class="mob_view" ><img class="hidden" src="/static/ver142/pages/img/schemes/1_en.png" alt=""></a>
</div></p>

<h3 id="page_link_4_2">Mechanism for individual trusted cryptocurrency management</h3>

<p>If a large investor were to join the platform, a trader would be able to offer individual asset management services to that investor, creating a tailored portfolio and managing only his assets specifically.</p>

<p>


<div class="scheme">
    <img src="/static/ver142/pages/img/schemes/2_en.png" alt="">
    <a href="/static/ver142/pages/img/schemes/2_en.png" class="mob_view" ><img src="/static/ver142/pages/img/schemes/2_en.png" class="hidden" alt=""></a>
</div></p>

<p>This feature will be implemented a few months after the platform&#39;s official launch, as per the project&#39;s roadmap.</p>

<h3 id="page_link_4_3">Voting system for adding new cryptocurrencies and ICO&#39;s to the platform.</h3>

<p>Currently, not all ICO&#39;s are fair and it may be quite difficult to distinguish a good project from a scam. Additionally, dishonest portfolio managers can use their own fake ICO&rsquo;s to steal funds from investors. Therefore, Safinus created an internal voting system for the addition of ICO&rsquo;s to the platform.</p>

<p>Only cryptocurrencies and ICO tokens that have been approved by the majority of traders and funds will be traded on the platform. Prior to investing portfolio funds into a specific ICO or cryptocurrency, the asset must pass through the platforms traders community. This is only possible if the asset receives a majority vote.&nbsp;It should be noted, that only portfolio managers can vote on the approval of the coins and tokens, therefore neglecting the possibility of adding low quality projects.</p>

<p>Thus, the platform protects portfolio investors from potential unethical and unfair actions of other platform participants.</p>

<p>

</div></p>

<h3 id="page_link_4_4">Mechanism for simultaneous trading on multiple crypto exchanges through one interface</h3>

<p>When searching for profitable deals, traders are often forced to utilize multiple cryptocurrency exchanges at the same time. This takes away a lot from the valuable resource of time.</p>

<p>The Safinus platform will be integrated with large cryptocurrency exchanges through its API. This will allow portfolio managers to gain access to a large quantity of orders and to close out deals with the most profitable prices.</p>

<p>Portfolio controllers are provided with orders from other exchanges if there are not enough required cryptocurrency orders on the Safinus internal exchange.</p>

<p>Traders can carry out operations on all exchanges that are integrated with the Safinus platform through its universal interface, saving time and optimizing their operations.</p>

<p>


<div class="scheme">
    <img src="/static/ver142/pages/img/schemes/7_en.png" alt="">
    <a href="/static/ver142/pages/img/schemes/7_en.png" class="mob_view" ><img src="/static/ver142/pages/img/schemes/7_en.png" class="hidden" alt=""></a>
</div></p>

<h3 id="page_link_4_5">Safinus Decentralized Crypto Exchange</h3>

<p>As is known, most crypto exchanges on the market are centralized systems. These exchanges have one huge problem: there is a possibility of them getting hacked. Unsurprisingly, news of exchanges facing hacker attacks spring up on a monthly basis.</p>

<p>Specifically, the Mt. Gox hacking scandal, during which hundreds of millions of dollars were stolen from investor wallets, acted as the reason for the multiyear drop of the bitcoin price.</p>

<p>Furthermore, an exchange can simply be closed down by regional authorities due to country policy changes in which the exchange is incorporated.</p>

<p>That is why one of the main objectives of Safinus is to create a fully decentralized exchange, which can allow traders to trade cryptocurrencies with full confidence that their invested capital will always be safe.</p>

<p><strong>The exchange will be developed through 3 stages:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>During the first stage, A traditional centralized exchange with the ability to connect with the API&#39;s of other exchanges will be created.</li>
	<li>During the second stage, a hybrid system will be created. Ethereum based token exchanges will operate on the principles of a decentralized exchange, with the use of smart-contracts. Wherein, the exchange of different blockchains cryptocurrencies will function based on a traditional scheme. A partial transition of exchangeable assets into smart contracts will improve the security of the system.</li>
	<li>During the third stage, a global decentralized exchange is planned, with support for cross-chain exchanges. This system will not be dependent on some controlling party, allowing investors and traders to feel 100% confident in the safety of their capital.</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to implement the third stage, it is necessary to develop technology, which will grant the possibility of exchange operations involving various Blockchain networks, with the help of Ethereum smart-contracts. Currently, there exist some technologies that allow for the realization of cross-chain functionality. The first option, would be to use Chain Relays, this technology is used by projects such as BTCRelay and ZecRelay. The second option, would be to use atomic transactions. Significant progress and results have been achieved by Project Alchemy and Altcoin Exchange through the use of this technology.</p>

<p>Our team is always keeping an eye on new additions to this field, and will only use the most effective and reliable technology for the creation of the exchange.</p>

<h3 id="page_link_4_6">Technical Analytics Instruments and Strategy Automation for Cryptocurrency Trading</h3>

<p>The Safinus platform takes into account a few instruments, which will simplify dealing with cryptocurrencies. This includes traditional technical tools that are used in the market for technical analytics, as well as automated processes, which allow for a more effective reaction to market changes and situations.</p>

<p>With the help of automated instruments, traders and funds can assign various logical constructions, which will allow them to not miss out on the opportunity to invest in a prospective ICO or to conduct a favorable crypto trade.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Automation of cryptocurrency trade strategies:</strong> The opportunity to set up different &ldquo;If&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;Then&rdquo; conditions. For example, if the price of a cryptocurrency will remain over a specific price point during a set period of time, then a specific amount of the given cryptocurrency can be purchased.</li>
	<li><strong>Automation of ICO token purchase strategies.</strong> The opportunity to establish the logical &ldquo;If&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;Then&rdquo; criteria is also available. For example, if the tokens of a specific ICO end up being 80% purchased, then a specific amount of token will be acquired.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="page_link_6">Competitive advantages</h2>

<h3 id="page_link_6_1">Existing solutions</h3>

<p>There are a few platforms that are attempting to solve current problems. However, their provided solutions are far off from being complete.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Platforms attempting to link portfolio managers with investors have very limited functionality, or the opposite, too many unnecessary elements, which complicate asset trading and investing. Some solutions might be unrealizable in the face of developing technologies, or legal limitations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, on some platforms, created funds/portfolios are tokenized. In such a scenario, a token is pretty much useless.</p>

<p>Attempts of attracting new investors to the market by means of realizing copy trading mechanisms and mimicking the strategies of professionals are also quite ineffective. Investors frequently can&#39;t physically buy the same asset as can a trader that he is mimicking, since he given asset might not be sold at the right volume and price at that moment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moreso, the purchase might be quite unprofitable due to high volatility. For example, a professional might have acquired a specific asset, but during the time of the same asset being copy-purchased by an investor, it might have already reached its all time high and start falling in price shortly, as a result, the investor will not be able to sell it profitably.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Safinus platform eliminates these problems. Safinus accumulates competitor best practices and strips them of their shortcomings. This, together with our own innovative solutions will allow us to create the best platform, granting security and ease of use to all users.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="page_link_7">Safinus ICO</h2>

<p>During the ICO, the Safinus platform will launch and distribute SAF tokens.</p>

<h3 id="page_link_7_1">SAF Token</h3>

<p>SAF - is a token created based on the Ethereum and complies with ERC-20 standard.</p>

<h4 id="page_link_7_1_1">SAF tokens and legal aspects</h4>

<p>The SAF token is NOT a security token. It is meant for use on the platform by portfolio managers. Token owners do not receive dividends, and do not participate in the managing of the company. Therefore, SAF tokens are utility tokens and do not fall under financial regulations.</p>

<h4 id="page_link_7_1_2">SAF token use on the platform</h4>

<p>In order to create a portfolio on the Safinus platform, portfolio managers must have a balance that is not less than 200 SAF.</p>

<p>

<p>The SAF token distribution will be carried out like so:</p>

<ul>
	<li>92% of tokens will be distributed during the ICO</li>
	<li>5% of tokens will be used for marketing and PR purposes</li>
	<li>3% of tokens will be spend on the bounty campaign</li>
