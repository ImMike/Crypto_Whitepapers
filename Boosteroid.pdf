		<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
		<p>People of the 21st century live in an insane rhythm and are forced to solve many difficult tasks as fast as possible. Not long ago it was impossible to fulfill them, but now, thanks to the development of the Internet and cloud technologies, the future becomes our reality.<br/><br/>Today, the most urgent issue is the permanent access to modern technologies that will facilitate and accelerate solutions of global problems, will allow them to be carried out worldwide and online. Cloud computing can be a perfect solution and that is why it is becoming more and more popular every day.</p>
		<div class="img"><img src="/img/white_paper_en/cloud_computing.jpg" alt="cloud_computing"></div>
		<p>Cloud computing is a model where all applications and their data are located on a remote server on the Internet and a user can access them from their PC or a tablet. Computers that carry out these operations are called a "computing cloud".<br/><br/>There are two main types of a cloud - public and private. Public cloud is intended for free access of a wide audience while private is used by one organization that includes several consumers.</p>
	</section>


	<section class="tendencies" id="tendencies">
		<h3>1.1. Tendencies and problems in the development of the world cloud computing market</h3>
		<p>According to the American consulting firm Gartner, total expenses of users working in the “cloud” reached $209,2 billion in 2016, whereas in 2015 the number was $175 billion. Thus, users’ expenses increased by $35 billion within a year. Considering analysts' forecasts expenses for a cloud are to reach approximately $246,8 billion in 2017 and will exceed $380 billion by 2020.<br/><br/>Such a high demand for these services is caused by an active transition of IT-industry data into cloud. Respectively, information technologies increasingly require high-performance resources to solve a number of tasks from artificial intelligence research to gaming, VR or analytics (Big Data analytics).</p>
		<p class="tendencies_companies">Top cloud computing providers in 2017</p>
		<div class="img"><img src="/img/white_paper_en/rate.jpg" alt=""></div>
		<p>Today more than 70% of cloud computing market is occupied by leading providers. Amazon Web Services dominates (around 34％), much smaller share is taken by Microsoft (11%), IBM (8%), Google (5%) and others.<br/><br/>An average one hour rental of a computation node on the basis of eight NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti graphics cards, two Intel Xeon E5 2680v4 processors, RAM 256Gb, SSD 960Gb (or their equivalent) offered by market leaders for European countries is:</p>

		<p class="comment">* IBM provides cloud services in the private cloud so the cost is calculated individually.</p>
		<p>New market players cannot offer significantly lower prices, as they develop only software products - add-ins for combining of already existing computing resources - and do not have their own hardware.<br/><br/>Not only face users high prices of computing power rent offered by market leaders but also difficulties in getting access to computing resources. Today users have to to spend a lot of time on registration and the procedure includes complex settings and information not always clear even for an advanced user.</p>

		<h3>1.2. Solutions</h3>
		<p>In October, 2016 we started working on the Boosteroid project to make cloud computing as affordable as possible.<br/><br/>Our team consists of information technology and artificial intelligence professionals. Initially, we were engaged in building computational nodes based on 6/8 NVIDIA graphics cards and Intel Xeon processors, which we used to conduct complex calculations for artificial intelligence. To ensure that high-performance equipment does not stand idle, we leased it out and were engaged in cryptocurrency mining.<br/><br/>We gained our experience and found out that thanks to our own software architecture and full operating capacity, the cost of cloud computing is significantly reduced. Therefore, we will be able to provide the service at a price much lower than leading market players offer. Budget-friendly rent will make Boosteroid available to every user of the World Wide Web.</p>

		<img src="/img/white_paper_en/scheme.jpg" alt="scheme">
		<p>A fault-tolerant, distributed, redundant storage system will be used in the Boosteroid project. Also, block-level stores are provided. In addition to the main data stores, a long-term storage with a large amount of memory will be built. <br/><br/>10Gb and 100Gb Ethernet switches will be used as communication equipment. They support the operation of the system infrastructure, high-speed computing network and data warehouse replication.<br/><br/>Software part will be based on software products, designed for server, storage and network virtualization, as well as IT-infrastructure transformation into stable automated computing environment.<br/><br/>This concept will allow to create many virtual computers within a computing cloud based on Intel Xeon processors and graphics accelerators (cards) NVIDIA with minimal capacity losses.</p>
		<img src="/img/white_paper_en/network.jpg" alt="network">
		<p>It will be possible to use the service both on PCs and mobile devices as the access to Boosteroid will be provided via browser, regardless of the operation system.<br/><br/>We will develop user-friendly interface to provide convenient work in the cloud and ensure quick access to Boosteroid services. Users will be able to connect to a cloud computer via VPN and use particular apps, models and games.<br/><br/>To start using the service a user should sign up on the website or in the app, providing their email or their login and password.<br/>Then the user will receive an email with a link to activate an account.</p>
		<img src="/img/white_paper_en/step1.png" alt="try out">
		<p>After that the system will offer to choose needed rental time (hours) and several payment options for a configured cloud computer. It will be possible to skip this step and complete it later.</p>
		<img src="/img/white_paper_en/step2.png" alt="hours">
		<img src="/img/white_paper_en/step3.png" alt="payment method">
		<p>There will be several payment options:
			<br/>- with BTR tokens purchased earlier;
			<br/>- with BTR tokens purchased via Boosteroid exchange service;
			<br/>- with a credit card. Any currency converted to USD is accepted;
			<br/>- with cryptocurrency.
		</p>
		<img src="/img/white_paper_en/step4.png" alt="platform">
		<p>Then the user will see a main screen where icons of the most commonly used apps, settings, cloud storage and Boostore application store will be displayed. It will be possible to change the location of icons and move them. <br/><br/>There will be both paid and free apps in BooStore. In the application store the user can choose software products and cloud computer rental time if it has not been done earlier. The user will select needed time and add apps to the cart where a final cost is calculated. The system will offer to pay for selected apps. To make a payment users should connect their credit card providing card holder’s first name and last name, type of the card - Mastercard or Visa, card expiration date and card verification value (CVV number).</p>
		<img src="/img/white_paper_en/step5.png" alt="success">
		<p>Users will see their reserved rental time and selected apps in the personal account when the payment is made.</p>
		<img src="/img/white_paper_en/step6.png" alt="account">
		<p>Then the user can choose the needed app and start it. Each app is launched in a separate window. It is possible to launch several apps available in the personal account at the same time. When users access Boosteroid services via browser they will receive a notification that they can enjoy maximum performance if they download BoostApp desktop application. It will be possible to play games or use apps that require high resolution video stream only via BoostApp desktop application. 15 minutes before the end of the session the user will see a pop up message with a timer and an offer to pay for additional time so that the user will be able to keep unsaved changes and prolong the session.<br/><br/>For casual users cloud computer performance and processing power will be selected automatically (considering the required performance of software products that a user needs).<br/><br/>Experienced users will have an opportunity to select the needed features of their cloud computer on their own.</p>
