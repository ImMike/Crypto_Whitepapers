                <p>“Banking and payments aren't the only industries that could be affected by blockchain tech. Law enforcement, ride hailing, and charity also could be transformed.” — said the subtitle of a publication by CBInsights called “Banking Is Only The Start: 27 Big Industries Where Blockchain Could Be Used”.</p>
                <p>For car leasing and sales industry the report quoted a use case already developed: “The prospective customer chooses the car they want to lease and the transaction is entered on the blockchain’s public ledger; then, from the driver’s seat, the customer signs a lease agreement and an insurance policy, and the blockchain is updated with that information as well.”</p>
                <p>Another solution “makes its own proprietary digital currency — like  bitcoin — which is recorded digitally  using blockchain technology. Instead of using a centralized network to call cabs, people may use the [decentralised system for] finding other people traveling similar routes and exchanging coins for the rides. These coins can then be used for future rides. Users earn (or “mine”) these coins by letting the app track their locations.</p>

                <p>According to Accenture in its report “Beyond the Buzz: The potential of Blockchain Technology for Airlines”, there is a very
                    strong similarity between the airline industry operations and what blockchain technology has to offer. Therefore “it
                    is fair to say that blockchain and other distributed ledger technology has the ability to improve transactional flows,
                    improve trust and provide immutable record retention”. It further states: “Using blockchain technology for enhanced reconciliation
                    and data sharing is a compelling value proposition for this industry. The most creative and disruptive possibilities
                    go beyond pure financial transactions.”
                </p>
                <p>Capco, the global business and technology consultancy for the financial services industry, has conducted a report for the
                    International Air Transport Association (IATA).</p>
                <p>The research focused on determining how blockchain may be used by the airline industry. They have concluded that blockchain
                    can make the industry faster and more cost efficient, enhance customer experience and the value of the industry.
                </p>
                <p>“Blockchain is a disruptive technology and represents a great opportunity for digital innovation. Every single industry,
                    from the financial sector to aviation, is trying to understand where this technology will best fit and where to start
                    the innovation journey. Distributed ledger technology – including blockchain – is already proven to reduce transaction
                    fees when transferring money across borders and currencies,” “That represents a great promise, particularly for global
                    businesses and industries.” Assad Mahmood, senior consultant, Capco.

                    Services.

                <p>The German Lufthansa has introduced the BC4a initiative to bring together software developers, aircraft builders, MRO (Maintenance,
                    Repair and Overhaul) service providers, logistics, leasing companies and regulators and develop the use cases for blockchain
                    in such areas as identity management, security, ticketing, loyalty, luggage custody-change tracking, maintenance, air
                    cargo, other use cases, such as: in-flight entertainment, traveller compensation, flight planning, etc.
                </p>
                <p>“Blockchain technology will continue to take flight in airlines over the next decade. Use cases not even conceived of today
                    will become every day, reducing complexity and costs while improving the travel journey with real-time travel experiences,”

            <div class="col-2">
                <p>You go out on the street and you have got some McFly tokens. Tokens are “flight itself”. You use them to order an aerial
                    vehicle (electric vertical take-off and landing, autonomous or semi-piloted) to the nearest landing area or directly
                    to your house roof and you use your mobile device.</p>
                <p>At times you will wish to vote to get priority service (for example, in case of a temporary lack of available vehicles in
                    your area). Then you do it in two ways:</p>
                <ul class="break_avoid">
                    <li>With the number of tokens in your wallet (without spending them, this affects the "class of service")</li>
                    <li>By consenting to a higher tariff determined by demand and supply ratio at the moment. (And the decentralized system allows
                        you to see real-time changes in the current demand and supply of network capacity in your area and your fair trading
                        will form the final flight price)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The aerial vehicle then arrives to take you to the desired destination and some tokens are transferred from the client’s
                    wallet into the "current" (operational) wallet of the vehicle. From this wallet the vehicle autonomously settles all
                    associated costs of the urban flight and its ecosystem and infrastructure:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Battery recharge costs</li>
                    <li>Landing site (vertiport) rent</li>
                    <li>Purchase of media content the passenger opted to enjoy</li>
                    <li>Scheduled maintenance</li>
                    <li>Air traffic control</li>
                    <li>Insurance costs, etc</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The vehicle may even track cabin damage and other excessive use of its resources and issues additional bill to the passenger on the smart contract basis.</p>

                <p>Upon landing the vehicle settles costs related to its resource consumption by transferring respective amount of tokens into
                    its internal “total flight” counter called "resource wallet". This is the life time “meter” of each vehicle, much like the
                    odometer is used to measure the lifetime of the automobile. Tokens on the resource wallet represent the total flight that
                    the vehicle has already performed. Therefore, capacity of the resource wallet is the indicator of the remaining life the
                    vehicle has remaining. It is counterfeit-proof as the information is stored on the blockchain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Total life of the Bartini 4-seater vehicle corresponds to 700,000 McFly tokens on the resource wallet, and of the 2-seater
                    — to 500,000 tokens. As soon as this amount is reached the vehicle is recycled and tokens are then transferred to the manufacturer
                    to pay for the new vehicle for the city.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The exact number of tokens to be transferred from the current wallet to the resource wallet for any particular trip is determined
                    by an open calculation algorithm based on the usage rate of each technical component and of the whole vehicle.

                </p>
                <p>
                    While many fintech blockchain projects aim to tokenize assets, projects or products, blockchain.aero is the platform to
                    tokenize flight itself, including all parts, functions and values of infrastructure required to make the mass urban flight
                    an affordable commodity. One token shall technically equal to roughly one minute of flight — a unit in which all value across
                    the mass urban flight value chain shall be measured for a decentralized community- backed mass urban aviation system to emerge.
                    Thus it becomes the common denominator for the community’s effort and all involved projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In today’s world one minute of flight may generally be valued between USD 15 and USD 40 on a chartered helicopter (and Uber
                    estimated the flight tariff to equal initially at Uber- Black service rates and to go down to UberX rates). So the aim of
                    the mass urban aviation community and the blockchain.aero consortium is to make McFly token even more affordable through
                    effective operation and management of the infrastructure and the vehicles and the economic system. Ironically, McFly token
                    may be the only token that aims to reduce in its relative value, while urban flight rebrands itself from exclusive service
                    to a commodity.

                    <p>
                        Bartini’s goal within the Consortium is to develop, manufacture, provide and put in operation the 4-seater and 2-seater
                        urban aerial vehicles. Blockchain technology will be used to make its flights available to holders of McFly tokens. Bartini
                        operates on the Blockchain.aero’s premise that one unit of measurement can apply to both the technical lifetime of the vehicle
                        and to value of its function.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are several considerations behind this. Firstly, conventional lifetime measuring in flight hours or kilometers is
                        hardly applied to a vehicle which is effectively comprised of two — a hover and a cruiser. Therefore a synthetic unit of
                        measurement is required. Secondly, future decentralized use of urban aerial vehicles (ridesharing in a larger sharing economy)
                        in different geographic markets, as well as most current technological trends, push for keeping all the information across
                        the whole value chain on one blockchain. Finally, blockchain tokens, being an integral part of the blockchain technology,
                        can be used both a) to measure the aerial vehicle’s available flying resource and its consumption in different flight modes,
                        under different loads, and b) to be accounted for in wallets held by both passengers and vehicles themselves.

                        The community aims to expand and include and develop the required technologies in parallel with the aerial vehicle’s engineering
                        and regulation appearing in the key markets, including blockchain technology. To do this, the community created tokens, which
                        are already an integral part of the future technological infrastructure, as well as websites, models, prototypes, drawings,
                        certification requirements, visions of interiors, etc., which are already in existence. Tokens make an integral part of the
                        technology that can already be provided today for the community to maintain it. Blockchain.aero shall become the platform
                        to tokenize the functions along the value chain for the technology developers to integrate them for the mass urban aviation

                        Each flight, and even every transaction in the current (operational) wallet shall generate new tokens by the proof-of-flight protocol. Therefore in addition to replacing the depreciated vehicles, which shall be paid for by tokens accumulated on the vehicles’ resource wallets, the act of flying from point A to point B shall create new tokens in the system. These tokens shall motivate the additional production of vehicles and their delivery to cities, where more flights happen, i.e. where the network is comparably more loaded.

                        The volume of tokens accumulated on all resource wallets will adjust the ratio of the proof-of-flight token generation — this is the proof-of-age protocol.

            <div class="col-2">
                <p>Engineers from the Russian aerospace industry designed an a ordable, easy to mass-produce, urban electric autonomous aircraft (e-VTOL, aka “the flying car”). We have developed the product concept, constructed the small-scale model to flight test the aerodynamics and energy consumption, and established the market availability of the required components (batteries, engines, body materials, etc.).</p>
                <p>Founders obtained the patent and set up the company. The project went through rigorous scientific board review and received exemptions from taxes and customs duties for the Russian-based R&D centre located in Skolkovo Aerospace Cluster. Technology and design were validated at Uber’s Elevate Summit.</p>
                <p>Personal aviation is non-existent:</p>
                <p>helicopters are expensive and unsafe, airplanes need runways, and both need experienced and expensive pilots. The solution is a mass-a ordable electric autonomous four passenger VTOL (also known as “the flying car”) priced 3 to 5 times lower than helicopters and covering distances
                2 times farther at similar altitudes.</p>
                <p>The product is the two and four-passenger self-navigated aircraft (or a cargo aircraft carrying 400kg), sedan-sized, combines quadcopter with carrying wing. Passenger inputs the destination, the vehicle takes-o  vertically from any surface, tilt-shifts engines to “airplane” (horizontal) flight mode, which allows to cover distances over 150 km at 300 km/h on one battery charge (over 600 km on hydrogen fuel-cells), then lands vertically on arrival.</p>

            <div class="col-2">
                <p>Technology and configuration (coaxial variable pitch propellers in a quad copter convertiplane with aerodynamics of the carrying wing, patented) decrease power consumption up to seven times and ensure long-distance flights at altitudes comparable to small helicopters or airplanes. Expected market price may stay within $100k due to absence of complex components, wings, ailerons, chassis, moving airframe parts, as well as simple assembly processeses. High degree of body-shape variability within the aerodynamic solution, no need for takeo /landing infrastructure, safety due to 8 motors and coaxial propellers in 4 engine groups and human-factor reduction, noise-levels within urban regulation.</p>
                <p>Uber alone has estimated that they will need 500-1000 vehicles per each of 300+ cities. Each manufacturer at this time estimated the initial price to fall between $250-450k, which sets Uber’s demand at 80 billion USD. It is expected that mass produced vehicles will be priced at ca. $80-100k (and thereafter even $40k). There will be increase in private purchasing, as well as more demand will come from other urban public/private transportation organizers. We may compare the market size for that purpose with the market for pr emium automobiles, which stands to be 360 billion
                by 2020.</p>
                <p>Bartini has committed to the block-chain technology and to measure the lifetime of its vehicles as 700,000 McFly tokens for the 4-seater AAV and as 500,000 McFly tokens for the 2-seater AAV.</p>

                <p>While in some locations development of infrastructure is responsive to technological developments and innovation, in others it is pro-active pre-empting the future developments and challenges, and yet in the third type of locations it is a result of direct political will. By all means the future of mass urban aviation is inevitable and whether it will be a result of a centralized action of a commercial player or a result of decentralized communities pushing for change —
                        is to be seen.</p>
                <p>It is largely regarded that while centralization and political will to improve city landscapes may set the scenes and shape the landscape, for the flight to become a ordable not only large scale availability is required, but undistorted action of the market forces.

                <p>Ownership, acquisition or in any other way obtaining MFL should be undertaken only by individuals, entities, or companies that have significant experience with, and understanding of, the usage and intricacies of cryptographic tokens, like bitcoin (“BTC”), ethereum (“ETH”) and Waves (“WAVES”), and blockchainbased software systems. You must have functional understanding of storage and transmission mechanisms associated with other cryptographic tokens. If you do not have such experience or expertise, then you should not attempt to acquire or in any other way obtain MFL or participate in the MFL token launch.</p>
                <h4>WARNING: CRYPTOGRAPHIC TOKENS MAY EXPERIENCE EXTREME PRICE VOLATILITY</h4>
                <p>Blockchain.Aero Consortium tokens do not represent any formal or legally binding investment. The value of MFL which may be denominated in BTC or in any other denominator of value in various jurisdictions, may be subject to extreme fluctuations in price over short periods of time on a regular basis. Blockchain.Aero cannot and does not guarantee market liquidity for MFL. Additionally, due to di erent regulatory dictates in di erent jurisdictions and the inability of citizens of certain countries to use service providers located anywhere in the world, the liquidity of MFL may be markedly di erent in di erent countries. By acquiring MFL, you expressly acknowledge and represent that you fully understand that MFL may experience volatility in value and will not seek to hold any of the Blockchain.Aero Consortium parties liable for any losses or any special, incidental, or consequential damages arising from, or in any way connected to, the Token Launch and any subsequent sale, acquisition or ownership of MFL.</p>
                <h4>WARNING: THE ACQUISITION AND OWNERSHIP OF MFL ENTAILS A NUMBER OF RISKS</h4>
                <p>The acquisition or in any other way obtaining MFL carries with it a number of risks. Prior to acquiring or in any other way obtaining MFL, you should carefully consider the risks listed below and, to the extent necessary, consult an appropriate lawyer, accountant, or tax professional. By owning MFL you are agreeing not to hold any of the Blockchain.Aero participants liable for any losses or any special, incidental, or consequential damages arising from, or in any way</p>
