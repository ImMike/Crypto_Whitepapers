<p>Since 2008, when Bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto, crypto-currencies and blockchain technology have been increasingly settling down in our world. Limitations of Bitcoin's blockchain resulted in the appearance of a large number of blockchains such as Ethereum <a href="#references"><sup>[2]</sup></a>, which allows to create smart contracts in the Turing-complete programming language, EOS <a href="#references"><sup>[3]</sup></a>, using the dPoS protocol, increasing the throughput of the blockchain technology hundreds and thousands times. Blockchain technology is coming closer to the real sector of the economy and more and more people are talking about the possible use of blockchain not only in the financial sector.</p>
<p>Elementh has absorbed the best achievements of recent years in the field of blockchain, aiming at solving the problems of the modern world of e-commerce. Elementh is a blockchain for e-commerce, which is a register of ownership of goods with the ability to write specialized smart contracts and use of the nomenclature standard to quickly create various decentralized and centralized applications for e-commerce.</p>

<p>The concept of a decentralized digital currency, as well as alternative applications, such as property registers, have existed for several decades. The anonymous electronic money protocols of the 1980s and 1990s mostly depended on a cryptographic primitive known as the Chaumian Blinding <a href="#references"><sup>[4]</sup></a>. Chaumian Blinding allowed the creation of new currencies with a high degree of confidentiality, but their main protocols could not be widely spread because of their dependence on a centralized agent. In 1998, b-money by Wei Dai <a href="#references"><sup>[5]</sup></a> was the first proposal to introduce the idea of creating money by solving computational tasks, as well as to offer decentralized consensus, but in this proposal there was little information about how to actually implement it. In 2005, Hal Finney introduced the concept of reusable proofs of work, a system that uses ideas from b-money along with puzzles of the difficulty computable Adam Hackcash Hashcash <a href="#references"><sup>[6]</sup></a> to create a concept of crypto currency, but once again it did not become popular, relying on centralized computing as a backend. In 2009, the decentralized currency was first implemented in practice by Satoshi Nakamoto <a href="#references"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, it combined established primitives to confirm ownership through public key cryptography with a consensus algorithm to track who owns the coins, known as "proof of work".</p>

<p>The idea to take the basic blockchain technology and apply it to other concepts also has a long history. In 2005, Nick Szabo proposed a concept of proprietary rights protection with owner authorization <a href="#references"><sup>[7]</sup></a>, which describes how "new advances in replicated database technology" will allow the use of a block-based system to store the registry of someone who owns some land, creating a complex structure that includes concepts such as a manor, unfavorable possession and land tax. Unfortunately, at that time there was no effective replicated database system, so the protocol was not actually implemented in practice. However, after 2009, as soon as Bitcoin's decentralized consensus was developed, a number of alternative applications quickly emerged.</p>
<p>Disadvantages of Bitcoin's smart contracts, first of all, the absence of the Turing-complete programming language, led to the appearance of the Ethereum blockchain, a specialized blockchain that allows to write Turing-complete smart contracts. Ethereum plans to switch to the PoS protocol in the future, but currently it is still working on the PoW protocol, which affects the speed and cost of transactions in the system. A promising alternative will be the EOS blockchain, which is currently being developed. It provides the ability to write smart contracts, works on the dPoS protocol and makes it easy to create various decentralized dApps applications based on its own blockchain.</p>

<p>Since the advent of blocking technology, many people have been trying to link it to commerce, mainly in two formats: the creation of decentralized marketplaces, such as OpenBazaar, Syscoin, Particl, etc .; and payment systems using crypto-currencies in stores, such as Monetha, TenX, Plutus, and others. While the second group, basically, makes a replacement for PayPal and rather refers to the financial sector, decentralized marketplaces try to combine blockchain and e-commerce.</p>

<p>OpenBazaar was founded in 2014 and at the moment you can find 1259 products there. It works on the Bitcoin basis using IPFS for data storage.</p>
<p>Syscoin is being currently tested and is based on Bitcoin too.</p>
<p>Particl is still being developed and at the moment it's just a wallet for storing and transferring their tokens.</p>
<p>All existing decentralized marketplaces inherit the shortcomings of the usual online stores and online marketplaces, i.e. lack of a standard of nomenclature, lack of information on different product in a single card and of guarantees that the seller does have the goods presented on the online storefront.</p>
<p>It is important to note that all decentralized marketplaces are not potential competitors, but partners of Elementh blockchain.</p>

<p>Historically, the EAN / UPC code is most commonly used in commerce <a href="#references"><sup>[8]</sup></a>. Originally, the American UPC system was developed, containing 12 digits for the encoding goods and it gained such popularity that European countries focused on it. However, the entire range of codes was already involved in encoding goods of the USA and Canada while the goods and firms were exclusively registered in the USA. The developers of the European encoding EAN-13 faced a serious task - to extend the range of codes and organize an independent US registration system ensuring maximum compatibility with UPC encoding. The solution was to add the thirteenth digit to the leftmost position (it is usually indicated by the Arabic digit to the left of the barcode) using 12 digital templates like in the UPC. At the same time, it was possible to maintain the backward compatibility of EAN-13 with the UPC coding - the latter became a subset of the EAN-13 coding with the first 0 digit.</p>
<p>UPC codes were standardized and registered by the UCC (Uniform Code Council, Inc.) in the United States and the Electronic Commerce Council of Canada (ECCC) in Canada. In 2005, these organizations merged with the European Association of EAN and formed the global standardization organization GS1 <a href="#references"><sup>[9]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>This code was primarily created to automate the trade of goods produced by a great number of enterprises, so the issue of internal content was also important for standardization and regulation in order that different enterprises could not assign the same code to the product. Each newly produced type of goods was supposed to have its own unique code, and this was the main idea of the entire system. That means that if, for example, a manufacturer produces jeans, then jeans of different colors, sizes, cuts, should have different codes. Thus, if we have, for example, 10 colors, 50 models, 20 sizes, then we need 10,000 codes to encode them.</p>
<p>In its turn, same goods by different manufacturers, also had to have a different coding. All this was important for the automation of accounting in trade, automatic control of stock balances in warehouses, store shelves and so on.
The theoretical maximum of the GS1 code is 100 billion different types of goods (11 digits). It would seem like a huge number, but theory does not always correspond to practice, and the current situation shows that during more than 30 years of the system's existence these codes have not been sufficient. This is due to their unbalanced and wasteful spending.
Initially, 11 digits of code were distributed as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>digit for the prefix;</li>
<li>digits for the manufacturer's code;</li>
<li>digits for the item of goods code.</li>
</ol>
<p>That means that theoretically the system implied up to six hundred thousand enterprises (one hundred thousand per prefix), each being able to code up to one hundred thousand items of goods produced by it.</p>
<p>Thus, to date, situations where different goods can have the same barcodes or the same item can have different barcodes are not uncommon. The situation is being made even worse by the fact that retailers often simply print their own barcodes for a variety of goods sold by weight, thereby completely destroying the whole meaning of unique bar codes.</p>
<p>In addition, one should understand that a barcode identifies a product, not a specific SKU (Stock Keeping Unit). To understand the latter additional parameters such as serial number, excise and other types of unique identification of a specific SKU are needed.</p>
<p>Finally, barcodes are often not entered in the ERP system of wholesale companies, and each participant in the sales chain uses his own unique articles for different types of goods.</p>

Elementh's goal is to create an alternative protocol for the development of decentralized applications used by e-commerce, providing a standard quality nomenclature, guaranteeing ownership of a particular product and the ability to create specialized smart contracts for e-commerce. Elementh will achieve this by creating a blockchain with a built-in Turing-complete programming language, allowing everyone to write smart contracts and decentralized applications, enabling the use of unified product cards, e-commerce transactions and the transfer of ownership.

</p>
Along with the system of tokens, Elementh has a system of goods, which can also be used in a large number of applications, such as tracking the movement of a particular item from its creation to the current owner, tracking original goods and detecting counterfeit goods. Unlike the system of tokens, the system of goods also provides for the ability to "issue" a particular product at a particular address, indicating all possible item's data (such as name, manufacturer, bar code, etc.). And if identical goods are already present in the blockchain, the issuer will receive a message about it, and he will have the opportunity to indicate how many items of goods he wants to "issue".
<p>If an item has a serial number, it is possible to specify it when the transfer operation is being performed. To provide protection against data forging, only the hash of the serial number is fixed in the system, therefore only the person who knows the initial number has the ability to make a valid transaction.
In the absence of a serial number at the moment of "issuing" goods, the system generates it randomly and the holder is able to use it to identify a particular item of goods by printing out the QR code on the package, writing it in an RFID tag or in any other convenient way.</p>

<p>Each supplier / distributor / seller in the world has its own data format for goods, and, more importantly, its own nomenclature. Their number is huge and growing every day. For example, let's have a look at the search output in google.shopping for "iphone 7 256gb red":</p>
<p align="center">
  <a href="/ElementhFoundation/Documentation/blob/master/images/img_unifiednomenclatureofgoods_1.png" target="_blank"><img width="602" height="88" src="/ElementhFoundation/Documentation/raw/master/images/img_unifiednomenclatureofgoods_1.png" style="max-width:100%;"></a><br>

</p>
<p>As you can see, each store has a different name for the product, while the search results also present another iPhone model, followed by the iPhone 7 256gb of other colors and so on. An obvious solution to this problem is the creation of a unified nomenclature of goods that will allow users to see offers on the product of interest on one merchandise card and stores to choose suppliers that are most beneficial to them.</p>
<p>One of the key features of Elementh is the availability of a unified nomenclature. To ensure that the merchandise cards are as complete and accurate as possible, and to reduce the likelihood of creating duplicate cards, the cost of creating and using the card will be different. To create a merchandise card a participant will have to pay, for example, 1 EEE (the price will be set by voting of delegates). At the moment when the owner adds the item to the system, he is offered to use an existing card or create a new one. The use of an existing card costs 100 times less than the creation of a new one (for example, 0,01 EEE). The cardholder receives a reward for each owner of goods that uses his card, as well as for making a transaction using this card. Any participant in the system can supplement information in existing cards, and the cardholder can accept or reject the proposed changes.</p>

<p>Transactions in the chain of blocks must be safe, unambiguous and irreversible, and be carried out as quickly as possible to facilitate the reliability and decentralization of the system. In practice, the difficulties arise in two different aspects of this process: selecting a unique node for the production of the block and making the record irreversible.</p>

<p>According to the concept of decentralized autonomous DAC companies, decentralization means that each shareholder has an influence proportional to the number of his shares and that the decision taken by voting of 51% of shareholders is irreversible and mandatory. The challenge is how to achieve 51% of the approving threshold in a timely and efficient manner.</p>
<p>To achieve this goal, each shareholder can delegate his right to vote to a delegate. 100 delegate with the largest number of votes delegated generate blocks according to a certain schedule. Each delegate is allocated a time frame for the production of the block. If he does not produce a block, then their turn is skipped, and the next delegate produces a block according to the list. All delegates receive a payment equal to 10% of the average size of the transaction commission. If the middle block contains a fee of 100 shares, the delegate will receive 1 share as payment.</p>
<p>It is possible that a delay in the network can lead to the fact that some delegates will not be able to generate their block in a timely manner, and this will lead to a split of the chain of blocks. However, in practice this is unlikely to happen, because a delegate can establish direct connections with other delegates preceding and following him in the chain. With this model, new blocks can be generated every 10-30 seconds and under normal network conditions, the splits of the chain of blocks are unlikely or can be corrected within a few minutes.</p>

<p>The blockchain that will use the Elementh software will be awarded with new tokens of the block manufacturer every time the unit is created. The Elementh software can be configured in such a way as to ensure that payment of the block manufacturers is restricted so that the total annual increase in the number of tokens does not exceed 5%.</p>

<p>The system of tokens can be used in a huge number of applications from binding to assets such as USD or gold to company shares. The system of tokens is easy to implement in the Elementh blockchain. In order to better understand what a token system is, you can imagine a database with only one operation: take X units from A and transfer them to B, under the following conditions, 1) A has at least X units before the transaction is made and 2) the transaction is confirmed by A. What is necessary to implement this system is the implementation of a smart contract with the above logic.</p>

<p>To store goods data, such as specifications, photos, EAN codes, serial numbers, and others, Elementh uses the IPFS protocol.
IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System) is a content-addressable, peer-to-peer, hypermedia communication protocol. IPFS allows you to create fully distributed applications. It is aimed at making the World Wide Web faster, safer, and more open.</p>
<p>IPFS is a peer-to-peer distributed file system that connects all computing devices to a single file system. In a sense IPFS is similar to the World Wide Web. IPFS can be represented as a single bittorrent-swarm, which exchanges files of a single Git-repository <a href="#references"><sup>[10]</sup></a>.
IPFS is becoming a new important subsystem of the World Wide Web. Constructed correctly, it is able to complement or completely replace HTTP. It can also supplement or replace other systems.</p>

<p>Jack, the owner of a small store, was told about the Elementh blockchain and the opportunities it provides. Jack had not sold anything on the Internet before. Having learned about the new possibilities, he decided that it was time to try selling their shoes via the Elementh blockchain, using special applications for sellers. Setting up a store turned out to be quite simple and took several minutes.</p>
<p align="center">
  <a href="/ElementhFoundation/Documentation/blob/master/images/img_casestudy.png" target="_blank"><img width="460" height="650" src="/ElementhFoundation/Documentation/raw/master/images/img_casestudy.png" style="max-width:100%;"></a>
</p>
<p>Having connected his accounting program to the application, Jack managed to recognize stock balance and bind it to a single nomenclature with fine merchandise cards and complete data of the product features. Information about Jack's goods immediately became available to all members of the Elementh network. Steve saw the store with the boots he needed, immediately made the order, and Jack received a notification that Steve wanted to buy his shoes. Customer's money is immediately transferred to a smart contract, which means that the order is real. Having arranged the delivery of the goods to Steve, Jack began his usual work in the store. As soon as the goods were delivered, the money transferred to Jack's account, which means that he didn't have to wait for a long time and immediately invest the profit in a new product.</p>
<p>One day Jack decided to expand the product range and to sell branded bags, along with footwear. Without hesitation, he opened the b2b application for finding suppliers and manufacturers working in the Elementh blockchain and found the bag manufacturer LOUIS VUITTON. He placed the order, transferring crypto currency to the smart contract. The supplier, having received information about Jack's order, immediately formed a dispatch and transferred data on serial numbers to the smart contract. Now that the transaction is underway, everyone will be able to verify that Jack has authentic LOUIS VUITTON bags in his store and not a fake. This is because in the Elementh network each manufacturer can track the movement of goods and if several owners of the same serial number of one product appear, it means counterfeit and its origin is very easy to track and take necessary measures to notify customers about its existence.</p>
<p>Steve has long been using applications for finding the lowest price for the product he needs. Today he decided that it was time to order new shoes and just in a few minutes he found the couple he needed in Jack's store and placed the order, sending money to the smart contract. Steve has not been afraid to make purchases online and send money to unknown sellers for a long time. If Steve does not receive the goods, he will simply indicate it in a smart contract and the money will return to him. This time his order was processed almost instantly and the courier arrived an hour later. Making sure that the shoes are of the right quality Steve completed the smart contract and the money went to Jack while Steve became the owner of a new pair of shoes. He can easily sell this pair of shoes in the secondary market as soon as he gets bored with them because Elementh network knows that he has authentic items not counterfeit ones. Just in two clicks he will be able to put them up for sale.</p>

<p>In general, there are two types of applications built on top of Elementh. The first category is financial applications that provide users with great opportunities to manage and participate in contracts using cash, including buying and selling products and content online and offline, as well as tokens built on the Elementh software. The second category is non-financial applications, such as identifying fake / counterfeit goods in the supply chain, etc.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Decentralized marketplaces based on Elementh</strong>. Based on Elementh's blockchain any marketplace will be able to allow sellers to use existing merchandise cards without creating new ones. Data on the ownership of the product will allow you to get rid of counterfeit products sold through the marketplace. Unified merchandise cards will allow you to easily find the lowest price for any products. At the same time, it becomes possible to pay using any crypto currency.</li>
<li><strong>Tracking the movement of goods</strong>. The complete producer - distributor - seller - buyer chain, stored in the Elementh blockchain, will allow to find suppliers for any volume of products, up to direct order of goods from the manufacturer. We see it as the future of e-commerce.</li>
<li><strong>Search for goods by geolocation</strong>. Seller information available in the Elementh blockchain allows you to find the most convenient places of purchase for any item.</li>
<li><strong>Decentralized sending of messages</strong>. The ability to send messages allows you to contact directly with any participant in the transaction. This will allow setting up exchange systems, bidding, obtaining individual purchase conditions and so on.</li>
<li><strong>Store designer</strong>. Having all the necessary data to set up a store, the system allows you to create individual decentralized showcases for any vendor in the system.</li>
<li><strong>Fakes search</strong>. Data on all participants of the chain will allow to track the appearance of counterfeit products at any stage of the transfer of ownership of goods.</li>
<li><strong>Banking scoring</strong>. Access to data on all transactions of any participant of the system will allow instantaneous scoring of the seller, which makes it possible to build credit and overdraft systems by the banking institutions.</li>
<li><strong>Different verticals</strong>. Elementh blockchain can be used by any service provider, for example, hotels or airlines with ticket, coupon or voucher entity to store information and track ownership.</li>

<p>Since 2012 we have a working business in Russia called <a href="http://miiix.org/" rel="nofollow">Miiix</a>. It's working right now, we have more than 200 online stores and marketplaces working with us. One of these stores was Ulmart and we made a connector to SAP Hybris, so that they can use the matched nomenclature of goods for their marketplace. As soon as Ulmart has business problems right now, this connector was not implemented fully in their business. We also discussed with SAP and SAP Hybris in Russia the opportunity to PR this solution to other SAP customers worldwide. In 2018 we're going to participate in SAP COIL program to test everything and use this solution at SAP store.</p>
<p>One of Miiix customers is Sberbank AST - biggest tender platform in Russia. They need to match goods from different suppliers there. We process about 2,000,000 SKUs in a month for them right now.</p>
<p>We also have 200+ small and medium online stores and marketplaces as a customers at Miiix product.</p>

<p>The direct competitors of the project are the existing online B2B e-commerce projects, such as Indix. In this segment, the Elementh project is innovative use Blockchain and can be used by decentralized marketplaces that use cryptocurrencies for internal payments.
Also there are some Blockchain platforms for Ecommerce as competitors for Elementh, for example the VeChain, INS Ecosystem, Connectius, Flipz, StopTheFakes etc. It’s interesting, that some of them are niche products, and all are not really infrastructure platforms but just something like applications for smart contracts for e-commerce.
We think that Elementh is more infrastructure project and can be used by different marketplaces and platforms. Also, an important advantage for Elementh is a huge experience in B2B Ecommerce market since 2012 and working business with real customers already.
Different marketplaces are also some kind of competitors for Elementh project, because they can be developed without Elementh and in this case they will work in the same market. It’s very important for Elementh team to get partnership with all current decentralized marketplaces that are already working or going to start soon.</p>

<p>The Elementh protocol was originally conceived as an enhanced version of the crypto currency, providing advanced functions for e-commerce such as ownership of the product, financial contracts, etc. The Elementh protocol will not support any of the applications directly, but the presence of the Turing-complete programming language means that theoretically arbitrary contracts can be created for any type of transactions and applications. Even more interesting is that Elementh protocol has gone much further than the usual crypto-currency. The protocol that can be used to create decentralized marketplaces, identify counterfeit products, and much more, has a huge potential to significantly improve the efficiency of the e-commerce industry and can give a huge boost to the development of other peer-to-peer protocols by adding the first economic layer.</p>
<p>The concept of an arbitrary state transition function, as well as the ownership of goods, implemented in the Elementh protocol, gives the platform a unique potential. Instead of being a closed, purpose-oriented protocol for a specific set of applications in the field of data storage, gambling or finance, Elementh is an open general-purpose protocol. We strongly believe that it is very well suited for use as a base layer for a very large number of financial and non-financial protocols in the nearest future.</p>
