			<h2>1. Abstract</h2>
			<p>
				The global Gaming and Betting industry has been around for years and will be around for many more owing
				to the attractiveness and growing demand within the industry. Despite this, there are undeniably
				fundamental issues which the Gaming and Betting industry is confronted with. The Gron Digital platform,
				which will be discussed below, aims to promote innovation. Furthermore, the platform will provide
				assurance to all role players as transactions in the industry guarantee transparency and fairness
				through the cryptographically verified code, rather than human intervention.
			</p>
			<p>
				This conceptual paper captures the Blockchain Protocol for fair gaming. The paper will establish how
				Gron Digital creates a platform that will realign the global Gaming and Betting market through reliable
				and autonomous transactions on the Blockchain. This platform will generate an economy among users, which
				is catered for everyone by allowing broad-based participation in the following roles:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Game and Application Developers;</li>
				<li>Bankroll & Risk Backers;</li>
				<li>Service Providers;</li>
				<li>Operators;</li>
				<li>Gaming Laboratories and Certifying Authorities;</li>
				<li>Regulators; and</li>
				<li>Players.</li>
			</ul>
			
			
			<h2>2. Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				The size of the regulated global online Gaming and Betting market in 2016 was $45.86 billion, while
				forecasts indicate an increase of up to $56.05 billion by 2018. There is no solid data regarding the
				size of the illegal market, however it is estimated at around $200 - $400 billion annually. One can
				argue that this lucrative industry is often associated with negative connotations. However, the
				questions remains – can these perceptions be changed? Gron Digital proposes a Gaming and Betting economy
				built on the Blockchain that is run by Smart Contracts. A Smart Contract is a self-executing contract,
				whereby the agreed terms of the contract between the parties are directly written into lines of code.
				This platform will bring the inherent benefits of trust, transparency and certainty to our economy
				presenting players with an open and fair alternative to the norm.
			</p>
			<p>
				This paper will explore the proposed platform from a number of perspectives. Namely: regulation;
				barriers to entry; manufacturing and cost of certifying Gaming and Betting products and systems;
				operators and the players themselves. Thereafter, the paper will explore the features of our system,
				which include: Random Number Generation (RNG); auditable Return to Player percentages (RTP); our
				development tool for games; application development, as well as how regulators and operators fit into
				the platform, which allows them to optimize their current or new businesses. The Gron Protocol uses a
				utility crypto-token called GRO. GROs are used as a currency for transacting and as an incentive, as
				well as a reward mechanism for various platform users.
			</p>
			
			
			<h2>3. Common Industry Problems</h2>
			<p>
				There are many factors that affect the Gaming and Betting industry negatively. At the forefront, it is
				the issue of trust. Without trust people are hesitant to transact. Trust affects all aspects of the
				industry from fair games, to reputable operators, to the systems that hold customers’ deposits and
				manage their winnings. Current mechanisms are based on a model of human intervention and control, which
				provoke fraud and dishonesty. Players therefore are confronted with challenges that lead to distrust.
				The common industry problems will be discussed below.
			</p>
			
			<div class="content-subsection">
				<h3>3.1 Deposits and Withdrawals</h3>
				<p>
					When players make deposits into a gaming account, which is controlled by a third
					party, there are often delays that come with this. The deposits often take long to reflect or
					sometimes
					fail to reflect at all. How does the player know their money is safe? Withdrawals are an additional
					issue which players are confronted with. Often, withdrawals are only allowed above a certain minimum
					threshold amount and can further incur fees. Turnover clauses for bonuses and promotions, Gaming and
					Betting Tax, as well as reliance on third party systems for transacting on these networks all
					present
					areas where trust and efficiency are essential for a commercial relationship to exist.
				</p>
				
				<h3>3.2 Fair Competition</h3>
				<p>
					A monopoly is characterized by the absence of competition. This means that monopolies can initiate
					high
					costs for consumers, inferior products, and often corrupt behavior, which forces individuals to
					develop
					a degree of distrust. The effect is that monopolies gain greater control within the Gaming and
					Betting
					sphere, this means that monopolies may impede new entrants into the industry, by discriminating and
					inhibiting experimentation or new product development. Furthermore, financial barriers, which
					include
					the cost of entry for new operators and the costs associated with compliance, are more accessible by
					monopolistic giants.
				</p>
				
				<h3>3.3 Trusted Service Providers</h3>
				<p>
					An issue which is yet to be addressed is the issue of licensing. Players who visit and sign up with
					various service providers, may not always be able to differentiate between legal and illegal
					operators.
					This leaves players confused and deceived.
				</p>
				
				<h3>3.4 Fair Gaming</h3>
				<p>
					Are the offered products fair? Will one be treated ethically and professionally? From a development
					and
					software providers perspective, Gaming and Betting products have not evolved significantly. Apart
					from
					the cost of development, companies must ensure that Gaming Laboratories certify their gaming
					products in
					order to conform with fair gaming practice before they enter the market. These laboratories work
					within
					a strict framework that may hinder the creativity of game developers. Additionally, the code and
					logic
					of these systems involve the intellectual property of the developer or system providers, which is
					often
					a close-guarded secret. This forces players to trust the developers, their games and systems,
					alongside
					the Gaming Laboratory, which certifies the products for fairness. Game logic is programmed into a
					machine or a table game (physical or online) and is the intellectual property of the gaming
					manufacturer
					- who is unlikely to share it with the public.
				</p>
				
				<h3>3.5 Random Number Generator and Return To Player Percentage</h3>
				<p>
					Another issue commonly discussed is the issue of Random Number Generator (RNG). A simple example of
					RNG
					is lotteries. Lottery participants are forced to trust that the software code or physical device
					generating the winning numbers is truly random. Without such a system there will be an element of
					predictability when players place their bets. Contrary to common belief, the Gaming and Betting
					industry
					do in fact want their RNG to be as random and unpredictable as possible. This is to ensure that no
					player can guess the outcome of the next slot reel stop nor the winning numbers of an upcoming
					lottery
					draw. However, the actual problem in the world of Gaming and Betting is rooted deeper than the
					question
					of RNG. How do the players know the game is fair? The concern is that the game’s logic and Return To
					Player (RTP) percentage are taken for granted by
					players.
				</p>
				
				<h3>3.6 Pari-mutuel Betting (Pool Betting)</h3>
				<p>
					The issue of Pari-mutuel betting differs from fixed-odds betting in that the final payout is only
					determined once the pool is closed, whereas in fixed-odds betting, the payout is agreed on once the
					bet
					is placed. Thus, it is clear that the Pari-mutuel betting system raises the concern of transparency.
					Essentially, this may diminish trust among players as payoff odds are calculated by sharing the pool
					among all winning bets, this means that players ought to place their fate and trust in a third party
					to
					calculate the shares honestly and fairly.
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<p>
				At present, individuals and technology in the industry, have lacked the ability to solve the
				abovementioned problems, particularly the issue of trust and cost. Thus, parties in the industry rely on
				authoritative bodies and regulation to instill the trust, while costs incurred remain high for all
				parties. In order to overcome these concerns, Gron Digital offers a platform which caters for and brings
				together all role players in the industry, who can harmoniously co-exist and share the revenues. This
				will offer an eco-system that is transparent and trustworthy, as it allows people to partake in Gaming
				and Betting activities, administered by cryptographically verifiable code.
			</p>
			
			
			<h2>4. Platform</h2>
			<p>
				The development of the Gron Digital platform aims to create an eco-system where transactions are
				administered by cryptographically verifiable code without human intervention. This creates a Gambling
				and Betting domain for all participants that is:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Secure;</li>
				<li>Transparent;</li>
				<li>Guaranteed;</li>
				<li>Autonomous;</li>
				<li>Auditable; and</li>
				<li>Fair</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>
				The foundation of the Gron Protocol is that the platform represents a set of Smart Contracts that act as
				the autonomous trust agent, which subsequently governs all transactions. These Smart Contracts are able
				to automatically fulfill a set of predetermined conditions based on coded rules that are executed on the
				Blockchain. Through the use of cryptography we can provide security, transparency and a verifiable log
				of all transactions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Gron Digital will provide a set of pre-built modules that will cover all aspects of Gaming and Betting
				operations. Using our tools and framework, developers and companies will be able to assemble a selection
				of pre-built modules and build their own custom applications. Additionally, Gron Digital will encompass
				a provision for external development of modules by the community.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is also important that all role players receive some economic incentive for their participation on our
				platform. To enable this, all transactions are based on our utility token called GRO. All bets are
				placed in GRO, all winnings are paid out in GRO as well as any kind of development, bonus, incentive and
				fee rewards are paid in GRO.
				Broad-based participation is crucial to the success of any economy. Several participants have been
				identified by the Gron Digital team in the creation of our eco-system. In the post MVP (Minimum Viable
				Product) stages we may find the need to include additional roles. However, set out below are the minimum
				participants which we have thus far identified in order for our eco-system to function.
			</p>
			
			<div class="content-subsection">
				<h3>4.1 Protocol Development</h3>
				<p>
					Gron Digital will be responsible for the development and implementation of the Blockchain Protocol
					for fair gaming and Smart Contracts. This Protocol will benefit from the combined knowledge of our
					founders’ experience as well as the existing systems they bring to the platform.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Along with the protocol, Gron Digital will develop tools and a framework allowing easy application
					development. This constructor will have modules spanning across all the services and processes which
					are required to run a Gaming and Betting operation. Gron Digital will also provide a pool of casino,
					sports and lottery modules to kick-start the creation of custom applications.
				</p>
				
				<h3>4.2 Games and Distributed Application (Dapp) Developers</h3>
				<p>
					Development, in a broad sense, includes Gron Digital or any third party
					contributor who develops a functional game or service available to our platform. This could be
					anything
					from a unique casino game to a pool betting management service. It could also include outsourced
					development of custom applications for operators who prefer professionals to build their systems for
					them.
				</p>
				
				<h3>4.3 Service Providers</h3>
				<p>
					The industry relies on several services in order to operate efficiently, these include the providers
					of:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Fixtures and Events;</li>
					<li>Odds;</li>
					<li>Casino Games;</li>
					<li>Lotteries;</li>
					<li>Results;</li>
					<li>Statistics;</li>
					<li>RNG; and</li>
					<li>Line-makers</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Individuals and companies alike will be able to provide these services and earn a fee for their
					input.
				</p>
				
				<h3>4.4 Operators</h3>
				<p>
					Operators can be individuals or existing companies, operating within the ambit of law within their
					jurisdiction, who intend to move to the Blockchain or become a start-up by initiating an operation
					on the Blockchain.
				</p>
				<p>
					Existing operators who are looking to move to the Blockchain for the inherent benefits will still
					have regulations to comply with. Our Smart Contract will accommodate various compliance criteria
					such as: license verification; Tax compliance; KYC and dispute resolution. Operators will be able to
					use our tools to assemble modules that will suit their needs. This will allow them to operate
					effectively on the Platform.
				</p>
				<p>
					Start-ups will also have the ability to integrate modules, build their own applications and operate
					them on the Blockchain. This opens up the industry to fair competition, fostering higher standards
					and greater variety for the players.
				</p>
				
				<h3>4.5 Scouts & Resulters</h3>
				<p>
					Scouts are reward seekers. These are individuals who attend live events and provide the latest
					information in real time to the network. Gron Digital will provide a mobile application with the
					functionality needed to perform these tasks. There can be many Scouts at one event, who all proceed
					to report to the network. This accumulation of real time data gives us greater consensus and
					information accuracy.
				</p>
				<p>
					Results are a critical part of the platform, they need to be from a reliable source, highly
					accurate,
					verifiable and received quickly. Scouts and Resulters are rewarded with GRO in a tiered structure,
					based on the accuracy and speed with which they provide event updates.
				</p>
				
				<h3>4.6 Affiliates and Referrers</h3>
				<p>
					Driving the quality-traffic to a Gaming and Betting website is key for a
					successful online operation. Well-structured affiliate programs can assist operators in achieving
					their
					sales goals. As seen within the common industry practice of the once-off introduction fee, Gron
					Digital
					aims to deviate from this conventional system, by introducing a fair, lifelong reward mechanism to
					the
					Referrers. The said mechanism will ensure the continuity throughout the Life-Time Value of the
					Players
					referred.
				</p>
				
				<h3>4.7 Bankroll and Risk Backers</h3>
				<p>
					Bankroll and Risk Backers can be an individual or an entity acting in different
					roles or different parties combining resources into one Smart Contract. Their typical role is to
					provide
					the initial bounty used to subsidize games by coupling their utility tokens to a contract for a
					reward.
					They can back jackpot prizes or bonus offers on a big sporting event, lotteries and other various
					games.
					They are willing to expose themselves to high risk for a reward.
				</p>
				
				<h3>4.8 Players</h3>
				<p>
					Players are individuals that discover Gaming and Betting offerings on the Gron
					Digital Platform and partake in gambling activities by using GRO utility tokens. Players can also
					earn
					rewards for referrals, through first play promotional adoption of a newly developed game, as well as
					through various incentive and bonus schemes that will be provided by operators. At Gron Digital we
					believe that other customers will add value as the eco-system develops and as various needs arise.
				</p>
				
				<h3>4.9 Regulators</h3>
				<p>
					The aim of a regulated Gaming and Betting industry is to ensure that all role players involved in
					any
					gambling activities are brought within the boarder of the regulatory legal framework. Effective
					regulations ensure that the industry upholds national and internationally recognized standards of
					compliance within the economic sector. Essentially, the purpose of legislation is to protect role
					players and ensure operators are fair. The manifestation of such an industry as an online forum, as
					well as the increase of people’s reliance on technology, may present real concerns as cyber-crimes
					escalate. The regulatory legal framework becomes stagnant and lags as it may struggle to keep up
					with the continuous advancement of technology. These negative experiences leave the regulatory
					framework static and the players vulnerable, damaging the reputation of the Gaming and Betting
					industry as a whole. Regulatory bodies will benefit from participating in the Gron Digital Platform.
					Existing regulated businesses may look to move to the Blockchain for the security and synergy it
					provides to the industry. This includes:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Tax collection efforts (which accounts for the majority of their revenue and coincidentally is
						the area where most fraudulent activity can occur). Tax can be programmed into
						our Smart Contract and paid directly to them without the need for manual intervention, costly
						audits and oversight procedures;
					</li>
					<li>All significant transactions will be recorded in the unchangeable online ledger offering
						guaranteed auditability and transparency;
					</li>
					<li>Digital signatures added to Smart Contracts by regulators can verify operators and their
						licenses in operators’ applications for added assurance and security for players
						alongside regulators alike; and
					</li>
					<li>Smart Contracts can also have built-in dispute resolution terms, which reduce the need for
						regulatory intervention when solving disputes.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			
			
			<h2>5. Gron Digital Economics</h2>
			<p>
				GRO is our utility token that will be used on the Gron Digital Platform. The utility token acts as:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>a Gaming and Betting currency;</li>
				<li>as a reward;</li>
				<li>a form of payment; and</li>
				<li>an incentive which powers the Gron Digital economy.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The Platform can be utilized in several ways, namely when making transactions and when providing
				services. At the forefront, GRO will be used as a currency. Perhaps one can think of the GRO as a casino
				chip. GRO utility tokens will enable individuals and organizations to play any game/s available on the
				Platform, to place bets with a sportsbook or play the lottery. All potential winnings will be paid out
				in GRO, however this is not limited to the GRO acting as a mere currency.
				Depending on the adopted role in the eco-system, participants will earn GRO and be rewarded for the
				services they provide on the Platform. The key role-players on the Platform include:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Game and Application Developers;</li>
				<li>RNG;</li>
				<li>Service Providers;</li>
				<li>Resulters;</li>
				<li>Line-makers;</li>
				<li>Bankroll & Risk Backers;</li>
				<li>Scouts; and</li>
				<li>Statistics Providers.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The value model is based on the fee earned for services provided. Fees can be fixed or incentivized in
				proportion to the risk taken or complexity of the task they perform.
				Gron Digital will earn a general fee to support continuous improvements to the protocol, development of
				modules and tools for application development, as well as to fund operations and marketing. Once our
				crowdfunding initiative succeeds and the utility tokens are issued, GRO will be listed and traded on
				major exchanges.
			</p>
			
			
			<h2>6. Competitive Analysis</h2>
			<p>
				The Blockchain domain has become increasingly relevant since the launch of Bitcoin and other
				cryptocurrencies. The growing demand for the Blockchain adoption continues and will continue as new
				ideas enter the market daily. The Blockchain has the potential to benefit multiple industries. This is
				particularly evident in the clear synergy between the Blockchain and the Gambling industry.
			</p>
			<p>
				Gron Digital has several key advantages over its competitors. The founders of Gron Digital possess the
				relevant expertise in the industry:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>We are a legal Licensed Manufacturer and Service Provider to the Gaming Industry;</li>
				<li>We have the knowledge and hands-on experience in the Gaming and Betting domain;</li>
				<li>We have the IT infrastructure, necessary expertise, the management and the development team required
					to execute a project of this nature efficiently; and</li>
				<li>We have the Gambling and Betting certified products used in a production environment.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Gron Digital is not in the learning phase. We exhibit real-world experience, as well as existing
				functional systems and infrastructure which are currently servicing customers and the gaming industry.

			</p>
			<p>
				Our accelerated development timeline means our MVP blueprint for the incorporation of our current systems
				with the Blockchain is already underway.
			</p>
			
			
			<h2>7. ICO</h2>
			<p>
				The Gron Digital Platform will be based on its GRO utility token. The GRO token is issued on demand as
				contribution takes place, i.e. as 0,6 GRO is swapped for either ETH, BTC or BCH, an additional 0.4 GRO is issued
				and allocated to Founders, Team Incentives, and Initial Bank Roll fund, thus a total of 1 GRO is issued. The
				maximum of 950 000 000 (Nine Hundred and Fifty million) GRO utility tokens will be issued in the Pre-ICO and ICO
				phases, starting on the 09/01/2018 at time 00:00 UTC. The following cryptocurrencies can be swapped for GRO:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Bitcoin</li>
				<li>Ethereum</li>
				<li>Bitcoin Cash</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				60% of the issued GRO, maximum 570 000 000 (Five Hundred and Seventy million tokens), will be allocated to the
				Gron Digital Pre-ICO and ICO phases for public participation. Pre-ICO is scheduled to run for 28 days, followed
				by 4 rounds of ICO with each round lasting for up to 14 days. These tokens are issued by GRO.sol contract. After
				all 4 rounds (or if the ICO ceiling of 570 000 000 tokens is reached) the ICO will close. Gron Digital aims to
				raise 57,000 ETH in the Pre-ICO and ICO phases, the breakdown of each round is as follows:
			</p>
			
			<div class="content-subsection">
				<h3>7.1 Pre-ICO:</h3>
				<p>
					14,000 GRO will be sold for 1 ETH, this includes the 40% bonus allocation to participants in this round. The
					round will run for twenty-eight days or until the ceiling is reached.
				</p>
				
				<h3>7.2 First Round:</h3>
				<p>
					13,000 GRO will be sold for 1 ETH, this includes the 30% bonus allocation to participants in this round. The
					round will run for fourteen days or until the ceiling is reached.
				</p>
				
				<h3>7.3 Second Round:</h3>
				<p>
					12,000 GRO will be sold for 1 ETH, this includes the 20% bonus allocation to participants in this round. The
					round will run for fourteen days or until the ceiling is reached.
				</p>
				
				<h3>7.4 Third Round:</h3>
				<p>
					11,000 GRO will be sold for 1 ETH, this includes the 10% bonus allocation to participants in this round. The
					round will run for fourteen days or until the ceiling is reached.
				</p>
				
				<h3>7.5 Fourth Round:</h3>
				<p>
					10,000 GRO will be sold for 1 ETH. This round will run for fourteen days or until the ceiling is reached.
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<p>
				Funds raised during Pre-ICO and ICO phases will be allocated as follows:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>50% - Software Development;</li>
				<li>5% - Legal Framework and Finance;</li>
				<li>15% - Operations;</li>
				<li>10% - Marketing;</li>
				<li>15% - Advisors;</li>
				<li>5% - Contingencies.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The remaining 40% of GRO, maximum  380 000 000 (Three Hundred and Eighty million tokens), will be handled by
				GROVesting.sol contract as follows:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>40% - Bankroll (immediately available);</li>
				<li>30% - Team Incentives &amp; Bonuses (available after 26 weeks from the date the ICO ends);</li>
				<li>15% - Founders (available after 52 weeks from the date the ICO ends);</li>
				<li>15% - Founders (available after 104 weeks from the date the ICO ends).</li>
			</ul>
