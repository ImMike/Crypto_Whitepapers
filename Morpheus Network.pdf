The information in this document is subject to change periodically.</p><p>The world economy relies on fast, efficient, international importing and exporting. However, running a global supply chain business contains various inefficiencies. For example, sending a bulk shipment of flowers overseas can generate as many as 200 paper documents from a dozen vendors. The document that certifies goods, such as flowers, to be hygienic and free of insects must be stamped and signed by numerous agencies, and then transported separately by air to the import destination because customs agents require original documents to help prevent fraud. One small error on paper documents like these can result in delays that spoil a shipment or hold up payments. Likewise, multiple parties, such as exporters and importers, insurance companies, customs agents, terminal operators, freight forwarders and carriers, use a bill of lading. Typically, the bill of lading is sent by courier overnight after the seller receives word that the shipment has arrived.</p><p>The Morpheus Network can remove the complexity from this process. Any time a document needs to be shared with multiple institutions, putting that record on the blockchain enables real-time updates that can be seen, but not tampered with or inadvertently altered. This can create significant savings in time and cost while at the same time, ensuring a strong level of trust.</p><p>The Morpheus Network was established by industry veterans to address global supply chain inefficiencies, resulting in a full-service, global, automated, supply chain platform for the global trade industry, utilizing blockchain technology. We recognize blockchain as a technology to be leveraged across supply chains to see breakthroughs in automation, optimization, security, visibility and forecasting.</p><p>Automation is achieved utilizing <a href="http://morpheus.network/why-ethereum/">Smart Contracts</a>, driving the supply chain with predetermined, automated work contracts, shipping &amp; customs documents as well as automated international payments.  The layering of other Blockchain technologies, as a part of , or an objective in the Smart Contract, is another key feature further enabling supply chain automation.  This involves the integration with other blockchains such as using the Walton Blockchain to signify the arrival of a shipment with an RFID scan, or using Sia to verify the transfer of data as a single objective in a supply chain<a href="http://morpheus.network/why-ethereum/"> Smart Contract</a>.</p><h2><span class="ez-toc-section" id="introductory_video">Introductory Video</span></h2><p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/OG6xtZw2CR8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p><h2><span class="ez-toc-section" id="global_trade">Global Trade</span></h2><p>At scale, the Morpheus Network has the potential to save the industry billions of dollars. According to the World Economic Forum’s report<a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_SCT_EnablingTrade_Report_2013.pdf"> Enabling Trade: Valuing Growth Opportunities</a>, reducing barriers within the international supply chain could increase worldwide GDP by almost 5 percent and total trade volume by 15 percent.  This equates to a global economic boost of up to<a href="http://morpheus.network/global-trade/"> 3 trillion USD</a>!</p><h2><span class="ez-toc-section" id="instant_money_transfers_to_over_200_countries"><b>Instant Money Transfers to over 200 Countries</b></span></h2><p>The Morpheus Network enables suppliers, manufacturers and exporters from around the world to receive their local currency in over 200 countries globally. Conversely, purchasing importers can send their own country’s currency to finance purchases in other countries.  This is accomplished through integration with SWIFT which allows a direct transfer of funds into over 1600 banks.  Therefore, the network allows any company or individual to complete any complex international purchase and shipment, no matter the scale of the transaction, smoothly, easily and instantly.</p><p>The Morpheus Network is the first platform designed to execute large money transfers to over 1600 banks internationally, using the newest and fastest blockchain technology, as an objective in a Smart Contract for globally transacting businesses. It is designed to be used by importers and exporters replacing traditional bank wire transfers which are expensive, slow, unsecured and simply outdated.</p><p><img class="size-full wp-image-1121 alignnone" src="https://morpheus.network/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/average-transaction-time-white.jpg" alt="" width="1126" height="249" srcset="https://morpheus.network/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/average-transaction-time-white.jpg 1126w, https://morpheus.network/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/average-transaction-time-white-300x66.jpg 300w, https://morpheus.network/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/average-transaction-time-white-768x170.jpg 768w, https://morpheus.network/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/average-transaction-time-white-1024x226.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1126px) 100vw, 1126px" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To give an example, China is currently the most expensive major currency corridor, according to the <a href="https://remittanceprices.worldbank.org/en/countrycorridors">World Bank,</a> with the average cost of sending $1000.00 (£700.00) from the UK to China standing at a staggering US $98.00 (£68.60) or 9.8%.  Compare this with the small<a href="http://morpheus.network/FAQ/how-is-the-1-5-transaction-fee-distributed/"> Morpheus Network fee</a> of 1.5%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img class="size-full wp-image-1122 aligncenter" src="https://morpheus.network/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/average-transaction-size-white.jpg" alt="" width="394" height="480" srcset="https://morpheus.network/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/average-transaction-size-white.jpg 394w, https://morpheus.network/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/average-transaction-size-white-246x300.jpg 246w" sizes="(max-width: 394px) 100vw, 394px" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><span class="ez-toc-section" id="full-feature_automated_supply_chains">Full-Feature &amp; Automated Supply Chains</span></h2><p>Morpheus Network simplifies and automates the logistics needed for any complex, international shipment for any company or individual.

Also included is the automated generation of digital, ORIGINAL shipping documentation and contracts for the first time ever which are predetermined and templated.</p><p>Another advantage of the Morpheus Network which increases importer or buyer assurance, is our <b>escrow</b> payment service.  Based on the predetermined Smart Contract, with escrow payment in place, the funds will only become available to the exporter following completion of the<a href="https://medium.com/@jgm.orinoco/understanding-erc-20-token-contracts-a809a7310aa5"> Smart Contract’s objectives.</a>  Complete trust in a seller is achieved since all the objectives in the Smart Contract must be completed prior to the automated releasing the funds to the merchant!</p><p>The Morpheus Network also incorporates  the &#8220;layering&#8221; of other blockchain technologies to be included as necessary objectives in a given Smart Contract. These objectives may include a necessary data transfer using Sia, or a Walton RFID entry, or even a Ripple transaction which is integrated into the Smart Contract and sets off the rest of the automated objectives.</p><p>In addition, the Morpheus Network is using Artificial intelligence (AI) to further optimize any supply chain by gathering vast amounts of logistical data off of the blockchain. These findings allow container shipping ports to be planned and routed in advance and as necessary based on global traffic, port delays, weather as well as many other factors and sources of data. AI is also being used to prepare compliance documentation for an import, generated by the Morpheus Network, by more accurately estimating port arrival times.</p><p>Furthermore, our user<a href="http://morpheus.network/FAQ/how-does-the-morpheus-network-rating-claims-system-work/"> rating system</a> gives prospective Morpheus Network users assurance that they are dealing with a reputable and experienced business partner.</p><h2><span class="ez-toc-section" id="morpheus_network_hybrid_security_team"><b>Morpheus Network Hybrid Security &amp; Team</b></span></h2><p>Morpheus Network utilizes a Permissioned Blockchain which provides a hybrid between the ‘lower-trust’ model of Public blockchains and the ‘single highly-trusted entity’ model of Private blockchains. The Morpheus Network Permissioned Blockchain maintains the privacy of user’s data, without consolidating power with a single organization.</p><p>A trusted Morpheus Network Consortium will be established to control access to the blockchain and will play a role in maintaining the blockchain in a decentralized manner.</p><p>Document records on the blockchain can be accessed only by authorized participants; this can be all participants or only those that need a particular portion of the data. Document ownership and access can be anonymous yet securely identified between partners who require verification. In short, it can be widely shared and protected at the same time.</p><p>Documents are stored in an off-chain container which allow Morpheus Network Smart Contracts to harness the full power of the blockchain&#8217;s capabilities while protecting private data. This ensures the correct balance of privacy and transparency. One feature of blockchains is data immutability; once data has been written to a blockchain nobody, not even a system administrator, can change it. This benefits the Morpheus Network users by creating a secure audit trail of all documents and transactions to ensure compliance with local regulations.</p><p>Noam Eppel, one of our founding team member has a speciality in information security, having run a successful security company for 5 years. He has taught web security at a college in Toronto and created an online security course used by companies across North America. He has also provided security consulting services on behalf of leading technical companies including IBM.</p><p>Additionally, to help secure funds raised during the pre-sale and Token Sale, all funds will be converted to Ethereum and stored in a multi-signature wallet. A multisig wallet is a technique that requires multiple people to approve of the release or transfer of funds. The multisig wallet keys will be held by founders of the Morpheus Network team as well as members of the advisory board from companies including Deloitte LLP, TD Canada Trust and Toronto General &amp; Western Hospital Foundation.</p><p>Lastly, our<a href="http://morpheus.network/team/"> team</a> is filled with experts in their perspective fields from a functional standpoint including blockchain, global trade, international customs regulation, accounting compliance, payment processing platforms, legal, information security, website and DApp development.

Smart Contracts are applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference. Ethereum also provides a cryptocurrency token called &#8220;Ether&#8221;, which can be transferred between accounts and used to compensate participant nodes for computations performed.</p><p>Ethereum could be described as highly programmable digital money. Imagine automatically sending money from one person to another but only when a certain set of conditions are met. For example an individual wants to purchase a home from another person. Traditionally there are multiple third parties involved in the exchange including lawyers and escrow agents which makes the process unnecessarily slow and expensive. With Ethereum, a piece of code could automatically transfer the home ownership to the buyer and the funds to the seller after a deal is agreed upon without needing a third party to execute on their behalf.</p><p>Many of the slow, insecure centralized systems we use today can be built in a decentralized manner on the Ethereum platform. Decentralization is important because it eliminates single points of failure or censorship. Decentralized platforms cut out the middlemen which can ultimately lead to lower costs for the user.</p><p>How does Ethereum differ from other blockchains such as Bitcoin? Ethereum has a number of advantages:</p><ol><li>In Ethereum the block time is set to 14 to 15 seconds compared to Bitcoins 10 minutes. This allows for faster transaction times. Ethereum does this by using the Ghost protocol.</li><li>Ethereum has a slightly different economic model than Bitcoin – Bitcoin block rewards halve every 4 years while Ethereum releases the same amount of Ether each year ad infinitum.</li><li>Ethereum has a different method for costing transactions depending on their computational complexity, bandwidth use and storage needs. Bitcoin transactions compete equally with each other. This is called Gas in Ethereum and is limited per block while in Bitcoin, it is limited by the block size.</li><li>Ethereum has its own Turing complete internal code. Turing-complete code means that given enough computing power and enough time anything can be calculated. Bitcoin does not have this form of flexibility.</li><li>Ethereum was crowdfunded while Bitcoin was released and early miners own most of the coins that will ever be mined. With Ethereum 50% of the coins will be owned by miners in year five.</li><li>Ethereum discourages centralized pool mining through its Ghost protocol rewarding stale blocks. There is no advantage to being in a pool in terms of block propagation.</li><li>Ethereum uses a memory hard hashing algorithm called Ethash that mitigates against the use of ASICS and encourages decentralized mining by individuals using their GPU’s.</li></ol><p>For the Morpheus Network, the choice was obvious to use the Ethereum-based<a href="https://theethereum.wiki/w/index.php/ERC20_Token_Standard"> ERC20 tokens</a>. Any Ethereum wallet (<a href="https://www.myetherwallet.com/">Myetherwallet</a>,<a href="https://www.ledgerwallet.com/products/ledger-nano-s"> Ledger Nano Units</a>, etc) will be able to accept and store the Morpheus Network token.</p><h2><span class="ez-toc-section" id="technical_data">TECHNICAL DATA</span></h2><p>The Ethereum blockchain is in many ways similar to the Bitcoin blockchain, although it does have some differences. The main difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin with regard to the blockchain architecture is that, unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum blocks contain a copy of both the transaction list and the most recent state. Aside from that, two other values, the block number and the difficulty, are also stored in the block. The basic block validation algorithm in Ethereum is as follows:</p><ol><li>Check if the previous block referenced exists and is valid.</li><li>Check that the timestamp of the block is greater than that of the referenced previous block and less than 15 minutes into the future</li><li>Check that the block number, difficulty, transaction root, uncle root and gas limit (various low-level Ethereum-specific concepts) are valid.</li><li>Check that the proof of work on the block is valid.</li><li>Let S[0] be the state at the end of the previous block.</li><li>Let TX be the block&#8217;s transaction list, with n transactions. For all i in 0&#8230;n-1, set S[i+1] = APPLY(S[i],TX[i]). If any application returns an error, or if the total gas consumed in the block up until this point exceeds the GASLIMIT, return an error.</li><li>Let S_FINAL be S[n], but adding the block reward paid to the miner.</li><li>Check if the Merkle tree root of the state S_FINAL is equal to the final state root provided in the block header. If it is, the block is valid; otherwise, it is not valid.</li></ol><p>The approach may seem highly inefficient at first glance, because it needs to store the entire state with each block, but in reality efficiency should be comparable to that of Bitcoin. The reason is that the state is stored in the tree structure, and after every block only a small part of the tree needs to be changed. Thus, in general, between two adjacent blocks the vast majority of the tree should be the same, and therefore the data can be stored once and referenced twice using pointers (ie. hashes of subtrees). A special kind of tree known as a &#8220;Patricia tree&#8221; is used to accomplish this, including a modification to the Merkle tree concept that allows for nodes to be inserted and deleted, and not just changed, efficiently. Additionally, because all of the state information is part of the last block, there is no need to store the entire blockchain history &#8211; a strategy which, if it could be applied to Bitcoin, can be calculated to provide 5-20x savings in space.</p><p>A commonly asked question is &#8220;where&#8221; contract code is executed, in terms of physical hardware. This has a simple answer: the process of executing contract code is part of the definition of the state transition function, which is part of the block validation algorithm, so if a transaction is added into block B the code execution spawned by that transaction will be executed by all nodes, now and in the future, that download and validate block B.</p><h2><span class="ez-toc-section" id="applications"><b>APPLICATIONS</b></span></h2><p>In general, there are three types of applications on top of Ethereum. The first category is financial applications, providing users with more powerful ways of managing and entering into contracts using their money. This includes sub-currencies, financial derivatives, hedging contracts, savings wallets, wills, and ultimately even some classes of full-scale employment contracts. The second category is semi-financial applications, where money is involved but there is also a heavy non-monetary side to what is being done; a perfect example is self-enforcing bounties for solutions to computational problems. Finally, there are applications such as online voting and decentralized governance that are not financial at all.</p><h2><span class="ez-toc-section" id="token_systems"><b>TOKEN SYSTEMS</b></span></h2><p>On-blockchain token systems have many applications ranging from sub-currencies representing assets such as USD or gold to company stocks, individual tokens representing smart property, secure unforgeable coupons, and even token systems with no ties to conventional value at all, used as point systems for incentivization. Token systems are surprisingly easy to implement in Ethereum. The key point to understand is that a currency, or token system, is just a database with one operation: subtract X units from A and give X units to B, with the proviso that (i) A had at least X units before the transaction and (ii) the transaction is approved by A. All that it takes to implement a token system is to implement this logic into a contract.</p><p>The basic code for implementing a token system in Serpent looks as follows:</p><p>def send(to, value):</p><p>if self.storage[msg.sender] &gt;= value:</p><p>self.storage[msg.sender] = self.storage[msg.sender] &#8211; value</p><p>self.storage[to] = self.storage[to] + value</p><p>This is essentially a literal implementation of the &#8220;banking system&#8221; state transition function described further above in this document. A few extra lines of code need to be added to provide for the initial step of distributing the currency units in the first place and a few other edge cases, and ideally a function would be added to let other contracts query for the balance of an address. But that&#8217;s all there is to it. Theoretically, Ethereum-based token systems acting as sub-currencies can potentially include another important feature that on-chain Bitcoin-based meta-currencies lack: the ability to pay transaction fees directly in that currency. The way this would be implemented is that the contract would maintain an ether balance with which it would refund ether used to pay fees to the sender, and it would refill this balance by collecting the internal currency units that it takes in fees and reselling them in a constant running auction. Users would thus need to &#8220;activate&#8221; their accounts with ether, but once the ether is there it would be reusable because the contract would refund it each time.</p><h2><span class="ez-toc-section" id="financial_derivatives_and_stable-value_currencies"><b>FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES AND STABLE-VALUE CURRENCIES</b></span></h2><p>Financial derivatives are the most common application of a &#8220;Smart Contract&#8221;, and one of the simplest to implement in code. The main challenge in implementing financial contracts is that the majority of them require reference to an external price ticker; for example, a very desirable application is a Smart Contract that hedges against the volatility of ether (or another cryptocurrency) with respect to the US dollar, but doing this requires the contract to know what the value of ETH/USD is. The simplest way to do this is through a &#8220;data feed&#8221; contract maintained by a specific party (eg. NASDAQ) designed so that that party has the ability to update the contract as needed, and providing an interface that allows other contracts to send a message to that contract and get back a response that provides the price.</p><p>Given that critical ingredient, the hedging contract would look as follows:</p><ol><li>Wait for party A to input 1000 ETH.</li><li>Wait for party B to input 1000 ETH</li><li>Record the USD value of 1000 ETH calculated by querying the data feed contract, in storage, say this is $x.</li><li>After 30 days, allow A or B to &#8220;reactivate&#8221; the contract in order to send $x worth of ether (calculated by querying the data feed contract again to get the new price) to A and the rest to B.</li></ol><p>Such a contract would have significant potential in crypto-commerce. One of the main problems cited about cryptocurrency is the fact that it&#8217;s volatile; although many users and merchants may want the security and convenience of dealing with cryptographic assets, they may not wish to face that prospect of losing 23% of the value of their funds in a single day. Up until now, the most commonly proposed solution has been issuer-backed assets; the idea is that an issuer creates a sub-currency in which they have the right to issue and revoke units, and provide one unit of the currency to anyone who provides them (offline) with one unit of a specified underlying asset (eg. gold, USD). The issuer then promises to provide one unit of the underlying asset to anyone who sends back one unit of the crypto-asset. This mechanism allows any non-cryptographic asset to be &#8220;uplifted&#8221; into a cryptographic asset, provided that the issuer can be trusted.</p><p>In practice, however, issuers are not always trustworthy, and in some cases the banking infrastructure is too weak, or too hostile, for such services to exist. Financial derivatives provide an alternative. Here, instead of a single issuer providing the funds to backup an asset, a decentralized market of speculators, betting that the price of a cryptographic reference asset (eg. ETH) will go up, plays that role. Unlike issuers, speculators have no option to default on their side of the bargain because the hedging contract holds their funds in escrow. Note that this approach is not fully decentralized, because a trusted source is still needed to provide the price ticker, although arguably even still this is a massive improvement in terms of reducing infrastructure requirements (unlike being an issuer, issuing a price feed requires no licenses and can likely be categorized as free speech) and reducing the potential for fraud.</p><p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1190" src="https://morpheus.network/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Atom-MORPH-Token.png" alt="" width="3584" height="2278" srcset="https://morpheus.network/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Atom-MORPH-Token.png 3584w, https://morpheus.network/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Atom-MORPH-Token-300x191.png 300w, https://morpheus.network/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Atom-MORPH-Token-768x488.png 768w, https://morpheus.network/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Atom-MORPH-Token-1024x651.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 3584px) 100vw, 3584px" /></p><h2><span class="ez-toc-section" id="token_sale"><b>TOKEN SALE</b></span></h2><p>A Token Sale is a new way to help innovative companies raise funds.

We believe in interoperability and partnerships over competition.One of the most exciting properties of Morpheus.Network is the ability to connect disparate ecosystems - and competitors - onto a common platform. However, there are privacy and confidentiality concerns as companies using a single blockchain would be sharing sensitive data around trading partners, shipping patterns and volumes which can become available to competitors through their participation in the network.Morpheus Network builds on innovative <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-interactive_zero-knowledge_proof" target="_blank" rel="noopener">zk-snark</a> technology. This enables the confirmation of every transaction of physical goods in the chain of custody, so that a connected record of provenance can be maintained, without any of the players upstream or downstream of the transaction having access to information not related to that specific transaction.Morpheus Network is a solution with the power to meet the industry’s security and privacy requirements and serve as a backbone for an open supply chain network with full data privacy built on a decentralized blockchain infrastructure.Related FAQ: <a href="https://morpheus.network/FAQ/how-is-morpheus-network-secure/">How is Morpheus Network Secure</a>?</p><b>How is Morpheus Network Secure?</b><br /><p>Morpheus Network utilizes a Permissioned Blockchain which provides a hybrid between the ‘lower-trust’ model of Public blockchains and the ‘single highly-trusted entity’ model of Private blockchains. The Morpheus Network Permissioned Blockchain maintains the privacy of user’s data, without consolidating power with a single organization.A trusted Morpheus Network Consortium will be established to control access to the blockchain and will play a role in maintaining the blockchain in a decentralized manner.Document records on the blockchain can be accessed only by authorized participants; this can be all participants or only those that need a particular portion of the data. Document ownership and access can be anonymous yet securely identified between partners who require verification. In short, it can be widely shared and protected at the same time.Documents are stored in an off-chain container which allow Morpheus Network Smart Contracts to harness the full power of the blockchain's capabilities while protecting private data. This ensures the correct balance of privacy and transparency. One feature of blockchains is data immutability; once data has been written to a blockchain no one, not even a system administrator, can change it. This benefits the Morpheus Network users by creating a secure audit trail of all documents and transactions to ensure compliance with local regulations.Noam Eppel, one of our founding team members, has a specialty in information security, having run a successful security company for 5 years.

The network allows peer to peer transactions in a single step, as opposed to involving a centralized banking system, slowing down any transaction dramatically, as well as increasing total cost due to banking fees and non-optimal currency conversion rates.  The Morpheus Network solves these issues with the banking system, converting funds with real world rates using the power of the blockchain technology, and incorporating only a single, small Morpheus Network fee of 1.5%.  Funds can be kept in the Morpheus Network, or, using the platform's integration with <a href="http://morpheus.network/swift/">SWIFT</a>, deposited directly into a receiver's bank account in their local currency in over 200 countries.</p><b>What KYC information will need to be provided to participate in the Morpheus Network Token Sale?</b><br /><p>Less information is necessary to participate in Morpheus Network Token Sale than to use the live platform. Anyone, who is not a resident of North Korea, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Kyrgyzstan, Canada, United States &amp; China can participate. Verification of country of residence will be provided to participate.</p><b>What KYC information will have to be provided to use the Morpheus Network?</b><br /><p>The Morpheus Network is using the same standard protocol used by international banks. We are advised by Donna Stoppard, of TD Canada Trust, on the necessary KYC information required to comply with global standards for sending international payment transfers in regards to money laundering, terrorism or other illegal activities associated with the transfer of funds. The platform is intended to be used by the global trade industry, and we are taking every precaution to make sure the intention is fulfilled completely and lawfully.</p><b>How is &#8220;AI&#8221; being utilized to optimize an supply chain&#8217;s efficiency?</b><br /><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is utilized in a supply chain by gathering vast amounts of logistical data off of the blockchain. These findings allow container shipping ports to be planned and routed in advance and as necessary based on global traffic, port delays, weather as well as many other factors and sources of data. AI is also being used to prepare compliance documentation for an import, generated by the Morpheus Network, by more accurately estimating port arrival times.</p><b>What if I’m new to importing or exporting?</b><br /><p>The Morpheus Network aims to make importing and exporting effortless from your very first transaction.We offer full templated shipping and customs documentation. Your Smart Contract transaction will be arranged creating your company’s own templated documentation. These templates will be used for all future shipments in that same lane, with the variable being the specific container/bill of lading numbers pertaining to the shipment at hand. All this information will be permanently and immutably stored in the Morpheus Network.Tutorials can be arranged in any language. 99.9% of your time dealing with a new supplier using the Morpheus Network will be taken up arranging your Smart Contract for your supply chain. We would assist in setting up the shipping and customs documentation as well as providing you local customs brokers and shipping agents who can use the Morpheus Network with the permission settings you establish.Using the power of Smart Contracts, all your transactions, in any currency, to anywhere in the world, will be AUTOMATED with the completion of your Smart Contract objectives.  Complex importing and exporting made effortless.</p><b>How does the Morpheus Network digitize original documentation?</b><br /><p>Using the power of blockchain technology, shipping documentation (bill of lading, commercial invoices, packing lists, insurance documents, etc.) will be digitized and shared securely and conveniently between the exporter, the receiving importer and any freight forwarders and customs brokers who have been given access in the permission settings.  The layering of Storj, a blockchain data storage technology, is where any original documentation with specific notation or markings will be stored and accessed through a corresponding encrypted hash on the Morpheus Network blockchain as a part of a Smart Contract.  These digital documents will all link to the original work contract and payment. Once a document is added to the blockchain, it cannot be altered, which is the key component in digitizing original documents, revolutionizing the import/export industry.No more courier services required to send documents around the world. No more delays due to late or lost documentation. This is a major disruptive technology in the import and export industry.</p><b>How does the Morpheus Network rating / claims system work?</b><br /><p>Whenever a transaction is completed, the exporter (or seller) and the importer (or buyer) will automatically leave feedback based on the Smart Contract details.  The length of time of manufacturing by an exporter or any delays completion of any of the Smart Contract objectives will all be recorded on the blockchain in the dated details of any particular transaction.This info will be added permanently to the blockchain and will refer back to the individual seller or buyer involved and to the specific transaction the rating refers to. Thus, the rating system cannot be influenced by any factors aside from statistics of a completed Smart Contract. Furthermore, since the Morpheus Network is not a sales marketplace in itself, no matter if the seller and buyer interact using Alibaba, Amazon, eBay, Chinaexporter.com or directly without an online marketplace, rating system remains with the Morpheus Network client based on the actual payment and full Smart Contract details.All the ratings will be encrypted on the blockchain to the highest level of security for privacy reasons, but fully available to Morpheus Network perspective buyers and sellers.This system also incorporates claims for disputes that may arise in a particular transaction. If a solution cannot be reached for any given dispute, an independent arbitrator will be appointed to form a fair and unbiased resolution.</p><b>Do I need to use the Morpheus Network to receive payment from, or send payment to a seller or buyer who is already using the Network?</b><br /><p>We recommend using the Morpheus Network for all the steps of your transaction and Smart Contract. We provide the highest level of security using buyer’s local fiat currency to be deposited into the seller’s bank account to over 1600 banks worldwide with our SWIFT integration.That being said, each part of the transaction can be segregated (e.g. using only the payment processing, or the digitization of documents, aspects of the network) allowing the Morpheus Network to accept or send payments from, or to, any Ethereum based wallet or directly into a bank account based on the Smart Contract criteria. In addition, other blockchain technologies (such as Walton, Sia, Filecoin, Ripple) can also be implemented into a Smart Contract as their own objective. This allows tremendous versatility when using the Morpheus Network.</p><b>Are there any advantages to holding the Morpheus tokens?</b><br /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes there are!  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the event of a value increase, the Morpheus Tokens </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">will leverage your company’s buying power.   3</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">3.3% of all proceeds (0.5% of the total 1.5% transaction fee) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">paid via</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a Smart Contract will be awarded back to Morpheus Network token holders, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">thereby</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> passively increasing the value of tokens</span></p><b>Can a merchant or a token holder exchange the Ethereum based token for traditional fiat currency?</b><br /><p>Yes they can. The Morpheus Network allows fiat currencies to be deposited directly into bank accounts similarly to how a bank wire transfer would be received, but skipping the banking fees and avoiding the loss due to conversion conversion. A merchant can also withdraw funds from their Morpheus Network wallet, converted to their local currency and deposit directly in their bank account.</p><b>How does the Morpheus Network automate any supply chain?</b><br /><p>Smart Contract technology allows steps within a company's supply chain to be automated thus maximizing its efficiency.  Automated objectives include contract generation (and storage and "permissioned" sharing), shipping and customs documentation generation (and storage and "permissioned" sharing),  automated real-rate currency conversion, international payments , as well as layering in other technologies (tracking systems, ERP systems, bar code scans) to  automate virtually any supply chain!&nbsp;</p><b>How is the 1.5% transaction fee distributed?</b><br /><p>The 1.5% transaction fee is distributed by an automated Smart Contract, awarding 33.33% of the entire fee back to Morpheus Network token holders, passively increasing the value of tokens used for payments or investment, and the remaining 1% to the company earnings to be used transparently to stimulate growth of the network as well as maintaining the highest level of quality control for the platform.  The 1.5% transaction fee will charged in Morpheus Token and only after the completion of a successful Smart Contract transaction.</p><b>If one supplier wanted to use Morpheus, but his suppliers aren’t interested then he has no incentive to start using it, right?</b><br /><p>You can take advantage of the Morpheus platform to automate your own company’s supply chain regardless of your supplier’s use of the platform. All the blockchain advantages also apply such as an immutable ledger of your company’s shipping info, payment history etc. With our SWIFT integrated payment system, you can send funds from whatever currency you use directly into the bank account of your supplier.All the benefits of the platform will incentivize your suppliers to automate their own supply chain while saving money. We’re also working with some amazing customs brokers, freight forwarders and shipping companies to increase the rate of adoption. Ultimately suppliers and distributors would use the Morpheus Network to be a part of an automated global trade ecosystem.</p><b>Where are you located?</b><br /><p>The Morpheus executive team and developers are based primarily in Canada and Taiwan with the company registered in Taiwan.  We also have team members around the globe including the United States, Philippines, India, Belarus and Russia.</p><b>What is your post-Token Sale business plan?</b><br /><p>Implementation of the Morpheus Network is overviewed by <a href="https://morpheus.network/team/">Donna Stoppard</a> who is also a Project Manager and Piloter for TD Canada Trust. Donna is advising the Morpheus Team with the most advanced and rigorous platform testing prior to live activation.  Here is a breakdown of the platform testing and eventual wide release:STAGE 1 – Sample testing – Templates for IMPORT/EXPORT companies –SIT = system integration testing – typically the first type of testing and is completed in a “lower” environment.  It’s ensuring the blockchain code and Morpheus Network platform will be integrated to create an end user friendly interface.  At this testing stage, the platform is not live, but simply verifies that the technology built (code, logic etc.) is functioning as expected.BAT = business acceptance testing – completed after SIT is complete and all the SIT defects that have been identified during SIT are fixed.  BAT is for the Business.  SIT tests the technology (eg. logic behind the scenes), and BAT tests the business related specifications (eg. checking that mandatory fields have an asterisk, and that proper error messages appear if a mandatory field is left blank.)  BAT is also completed in the “lower environment”.STAGE 2 – Performance testing – Simulated real-world transactionsPCOE = Performance testing – completed in a production environment.  PCOE tests the performance of the Morpheus Network.  What can cause the system to crash?  What can bog the speed of the network?  Each factor will be taken into account during the PCOE testing phase. Complicated Smart Contract transactions will be simulated and accomplished.PAT = production acceptance testing – this is the final stage of testing that is completed and is done in a production environment, but the network would still inactive during this testing phase.  Testing is completed to ensure there are no defects when promoting the code from a lower level to a production environment and the performance and expectations for all test case are as expected.  After the PAT testing is completed, the Morpheus Network will be activated!STAGE 3 – Limited Network Release – Real-world transactionsWe currently have import &amp; export companies to test the network in 4 countries (USA, China, Canada and Mexico). The next step is testing integration to the EU, South America, Russia and to the rest world.STAGE 4 – Full global network activationSTAGE 5 – Continued growth and scaling management</p><b>What is the function of the Morpheus Token?</b><br /><p>The Morpheus Token (MORPH) powers the Morpheus Network.The token is a “value” based utility. The Network’s Microsoft Dynamics 365 ERP system is integrated with SWIFT for direct international payments.The Morpheus Tokens can be attained converting from virtually any fiat currency, or over 74 different cryptocurrencies directly through the platform and our Shapeshift integration. The tokens give users access to the Morpheus Network. A crucial objective in a Smart Contract of any global supply chain are international payments. The Morpheus Token’s value is based on the real time financial derivative of the currency needed to complete a payment as a Smart Contract’s objective. Our integration with SWIFT allows us to send payments directly into the bank account of over 1600 banks globally in the specific currency required (fiat or cryptocurrency) by the Smart Contract.</p><b>Will shipments be tracked for progress when using the Morpheus Network for international trade?</b><br /><p>Morpheus is designed to track imports, exports and location of shipments in real-time facilitated by the blockchain. No matter which objective is being completed, the Morpheus Network will be able to use the Smart Contract to keep track of the whereabouts of any shipment anywhere in the world. Extra tracking capabilities can be implemented such as Waltonchain barcode scans when certain shipping points are reached.</p><b>Explain the Morpheus Network Token Sale hard cap?</b><br /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the hard cap is reached, we will no longer accept any more contributions.  All the Morpheus Network tokens have been distributed, so additional transactions will be returned to the senders.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, any unsold tokens will be burned / disposed.  This means that no additional Morpheus Network tokens will ever be created or distributed after Token Sale concludes.</span></p><b>Why should I contribute to the Morpheus Network Token Sale?</b><br /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are not already convinced that the Morpheus Network will be the preferred platform for the import and export industry, then you probably need to reread our FAQ.  And if you are still not convinced, please dive deeper into our Whitepaper.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a summary, we boast the most </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">functional blockchain</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> payments platform for the  over 15 trillion dollar </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">global trade industry, but that is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">only part</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the Morpheus Network.  Our automated supply chain services will revolutionize the global trade industry incorporating automated contract and document generation, automated payments and integrating other blockchain technologies into the supply chain’s Smart Contract.  Our strength is in our platform, but even more so, in the Morpheus team, which possesses leaders in relevant industries to maximize the effectiveness of the Morpheus Network.</span></p><h2><span class="ez-toc-section" id="privacy_policy">PRIVACY POLICY</span></h2><p><b>BY USING OR ACCESSING THE WEBSITES, SYSTEMS OR SERVICES OF MORPHEUS NETWORK YOU SIGNIFY YOUR ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND ASSENT TO THE PRIVACY POLICY SET FORTH BELOW.
